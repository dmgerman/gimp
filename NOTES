Some notes on GIMP-0.99.18:

* The AA, MathMap, GAG, user_filter, rcm, FractalExplorer, and Gfig plugins
are included but not yet integrated into the build cause of instability or
other unresolved issues.

Please read the file TODO-DIST to find more information about things
that were not included or that are (possibly) broken in this distribution.
