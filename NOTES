Some notes on GIMP-0.99.17:

* The AA, MathMap, GimpTcl, GAG, user_filter, rcm, FractalExplorer, and Gfig
plugins are included but not yet integrated into the build cause of instability
or other unresolved issues.

Please read the file TODO-DIST to find more information about things
that were not included or that are (possibly) broken in this distribution.
