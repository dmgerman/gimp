Some notes on GIMP-0.99.16:

* The MathMap, GimpTcl, GAG, and Gfig are included but not yet integrated
into the build cause of instability or other unresolved issues.

Please read the file TODO-DIST to find more information about things
that were not included or that are (possibly) broken in this distribution.
