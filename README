The GNU Image Manipulation Program Version 2.2
----------------------------------------------

This is version 2.2 of The GIMP. Version 2.2 is an update on GIMP 2.0.
GIMP 2.2 is fully backward compatible to GIMP 2.0. Plug-ins and
scripts written for GIMP 2.0 will continue to work and don't need to
be changed nor recompiled to be used with GIMP 2.2.  We do however
hope that plug-in authors will update their plug-ins for GIMP 2.2 and
adapt the GUI changes we did with this version.

GIMP 2.2 replaces GIMP 2.0. It is advised that you uninstall GIMP 2.0
before installing GIMP 2.2. If you want to keep GIMP 2.0 installed in
parallel to GIMP 2.2, you have to choose a separate prefix which is
not in your default library search path.

This code has already seen quite some testing but a lot has changed
since version GIMP 2.0 and we could very well have introduced new
bugs. If you find any , make sure you report them at bugzilla.gnome.org
(after checking that it isn't reported already).

The GIMP 2.2 API is guaranteed to be backward compatible (source and
binary) with the GIMP 2.0 API. If you find that your 2.0 plug-in break
when used with the GIMP 2.2 libraries, or if you cannot compile a GIMP
2.0 plug-in against the GIMP 2.2 header files, please report that as a
bug.

If you want to hack on The GIMP, please read the file HACKING. For
detailed installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.


1. Web Resources
================

The GIMP's home page is at:

	http://www.gimp.org/

Please be sure to visit this site for information, documentation,
tutorials, news, etc.  All things GIMP-ish are available from there.

The automated plug-in registry is located at:

	http://registry.gimp.org/

There you can get the latest versions of plug-ins, using a convenient
forms-based interface.

The latest version of The GIMP can be found at:

	http://www.gimp.org/downloads/


2. Mailing Lists
================

We have several mailing lists dedicated to GIMP user and development
discussion.  There is more info at

	https://lists.xcf.berkeley.edu/mailman/listinfo/<listname>

with <listname> replaced by "gimp-announce", "gimp-user", "gimp-win-users"
or "gimp-developer" (without the quotes, of course) depending on the list
you want to subscribe to.  Links to the mailing list archives can be
found at the same addresses as given above.

Gimp-announce is a low-traffic list with announcements about new
releases of GIMP and plug-ins. Gimp-user is a mailing list dedicated
to user problems, hints and tips, discussion of cool effects, etc.
Gimp-developer is oriented to GIMP core and plug-in developers.  Most
people will only want to be subscribed to gimp-user. If you want to
help develop The GIMP, the gimp-developer mailing list is a good
starting point.

There is also a mailing list, "gimpwin-users", dedicated to users of the
Win32 port.  To subscribe, send an empty message to

	gimpwin-users-subscribe@egroups.com

You can also use the web interface at
http://www.egroups.com/group/gimpwin-users/. Note that as this mailing
list is hosted on egroups.com, the messages from the list contain
relatively unintrusive and easily ignored advertisements at the
end. But if you are absolutely allergic to ads, don't subscribe.


3. IRC
======

And finally, for the real junkies, there is an IRC channel devoted to
the GIMP. On GIMPNet (a private free software oriented network) there is
#gimp.  Many of the developers hang out there.  Some of the GIMPNet
servers are:

	irc.gimp.org:6667
	irc.us.gimp.org:6667
	irc.eu.gimp.org:6667


4. Customizing
==============

The look of GIMP's interface can be customized like any other GTK app
by editing the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file or by using "themes" (ready-made
customizations).  For downloadable themes and further details, see
http://gtk.themes.org.  Additionally, GIMP reads ~/.gimp-2.2/gtkrc so
you can have settings that only apply to The GIMP.

Included is a set of keybindings similar to those in Adobe Photoshop.
You can find them in the ps-menurc file.  To use them, copy this file
to ~/.gimp-2.2/menurc. You can also manually change the keybindings to
any of your choice by editing ~/.gimp-2.2/menurc.


Have fun,
