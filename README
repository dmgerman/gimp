The GIMP: The GNU Image Manipulation Program
============================================

This is version 1.3, the developers version of The GIMP. Only use
it if you are brave and curious and want to participate development
towards the next stable release version 1.4. Please do not yet report
bugs in this version. This is a developers version. We know it has 
bugs and it might not even compile. You have been warned!

The GIMP is designed to be a professional image manipulation program 
suitable for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image
authoring.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

1. Web Resources
================

The GIMP's home page is at:

	http://www.gimp.org/

Please be sure to visit this site for information, documentation,
tutorials, news, etc.  All things GIMP-ish are available from there.

The automated plug-in registry is located at:

	http://registry.gimp.org/

There you can get the latest versions of plug-ins using a convenient
forms-based interface.

The latest version of The GIMP can be found at:

	http://www.gimp.org/download/

2. Mailing Lists
================

We have several mailing lists dedicated to GIMP user and development
discussion.  To subscribe, send an empty message to

	     <listname>-subscribe@xcf.berkeley.edu

substituting <listname> for "gimp-user", "gimp-announce" or
"gimp-developer" (without the quotes, of course) depending on the list you 
want to subscribe to.  The mailing list archives can be found at:

        http://www.egroups.com/messages/gimp-developer/
        http://www.egroups.com/messages/gimp-user/

Gimp-user is a mailing list dedicated to user problems, hints and
tips, discussion of cool effects, etc.  Gimp-announce is a low-traffic list
with announcements about new releases of GIMP and plug-ins.  Gimp-developer is 
oriented to GIMP core and plug-in developers.  Most people will only want to 
be subscribed to gimp-user. If you want to help develop The GIMP, the
gimp-developer mailing list is a good starting point.

There are two mailing lists dedicated to the Win32 port,
"gimpwin-users" and "gimpwin-dev". Especially the latter also carries
traffic about the GTk+ port to Win32 in general. To subscribe, send an
empty message to

	gimpwin-users-subscribe@egroups.com
or
	gimpwin-dev-subscribe@egroups.com

respectively. You can also use the web interface at
http://www.egroups.com/group/gimpwin-users/ and
http://www.egroups.com/group/gimpwin-dev/ . Note that as these mailing
lists are hosted on egroups.com, the messages from the list contain
relatively unintrusive and easily ignored advertisements at the
end. But if you are absolutely allergic to ads, don't subscribe.


3. IRC
======

And finally, for the real junkies, there is an IRC channel devoted to
the GIMP. On Byxnet (a private mostly-GIMP network) there is #gimp.
Many of the developers hang out there.  One of the Byxnet servers are:

	irc.gimp.org:6667

4. Customizing
==============

The look of GIMP's interface can be customized like any other GTK app
by editing the ~/.gtkrc file or by using "themes" (ready-made 
customizations). For downloadable themes and further details, see
http://gtk.themes.org. Additionally GIMP reads ~/.gimp-1.3/gtkrc so you 
can have settings that only apply to The GIMP.

Included is a set of keybindings similar to those in Adobe Photoshop (tm).
You can find them in the ps-menurc file.  To use them, copy this file to
~/.gimp-1.3/menurc. You can also manually change the keybindings to any of
your choice by editing ~/.gimp-1.3/menurc.

5. Bugs
=======

Since this is a developers version, we are at the moment not really
interested in receiving bug-reports. If you find a bug, contact the person
who is working on this particular part of the program (check the ChangeLog)
or try to fix it yourself.


Have fun,
