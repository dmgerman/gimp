The GIMP: the GNU Image Manipulation Program
--------------------------------------------

This is an unstable release of the GIMP, intended for developers only.
For production use, please use the 1.0.x series.

The GIMP's home page is at 

	http://www.gimp.org

Please be sure to visit this site for information, documentation,
tutorials, news, etc.  All things GIMP-ish are available from there.

The automated plug-in registry is located at

	http://registry.gimp.org

There you can get the latest versions of plug-ins using a convenient
forms-based interface.

We have several mailing lists dedicated to GIMP user and development
discussion.  To subscribe, send mail to

	majordomo@scam.xcf.berkeley.edu

and in the body of the message put

	subscribe <list-name> your@email.address

substituting <list-name> for "gimp-user" or "gimp-developer" (without
the quotes, of course) depending on the list you want to subscribe
to.  The mailing list archives can be found at

        http://www.findmail.com/listsaver/gimp-developer/
        http://www.findmail.com/listsaver/gimp-user/

Gimp-user is a mailing list dedicated to user problems, hints and
tips, discussion of cool effects, etc.  Gimp-developer is oriented to
GIMP core and plug-in developers.  Most people will only want to be
subscribed to gimp-user.

And finally, for the real junkies, there is an IRC channel devoted to
the GIMP :-) On Byxnet (a private mostly-GIMP network) there is #gimp.
Many of the developers hang out there.  Some of the Byxnet servers are:

	irc.gimp.org:6667

The look of GIMP's interface can be customized like any other GTK app
by editing the ~/.gtkrc file. Additionally GIMP reads ~/.gimp/gtkrc
so you can have settings that only apply to The GIMP. 

Included is a set of keybindings similar to those in Adobe Photoshop (tm).
You can find them in the ps-menurc file.  To use them, copy this file to
~/.gimp/menurc

We sincerely hope you enjoy the program.  Please report problems to
bugs@gimp.org.  Before reporting a problem, you may want to see if someone
else has already did (check http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgimp.html for
this).

Have fun,
