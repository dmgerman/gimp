The GIMP: The GNU Image Manipulation Program
============================================

This is an unstable release of the GIMP, intended for developers only.
For production use, please use the 1.0.x series.

The GIMP is designed to be a professional image manipulation program 
for both print and on-line based outputs.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

1. Web Resources
================

The GIMP's home page is at:

	http://www.gimp.org/

Please be sure to visit this site for information, documentation,
tutorials, news, etc.  All things GIMP-ish are available from there.

The automated plug-in registry is located at:

	http://registry.gimp.org/

There you can get the latest versions of plug-ins using a convenient
forms-based interface.

The latest version of The GIMP can be found at:

	http://www.gimp.org/download/

2. Mailing Lists
================

We have several mailing lists dedicated to GIMP user and development
discussion.  To subscribe, send an empty message to

	     <listname>-subscribe@xcf.berkeley.edu

substituting <list-name> for "gimp-user", "gimp-win-user", "gimp-announce" or
"gimp-developer" (without the quotes, of course) depending on the list you 
want to subscribe to.  The mailing list archives can be found at:

        http://www.egroups.com/messages/gimp-developer/
        http://www.egroups.com/messages/gimp-user/

Gimp-user is a mailing list dedicated to user problems, hints and
tips, discussion of cool effects, etc.  Gimp-win-user is a list to discuss 
user problems specific to the Win32 port.  Gimp-announce is a low-traffic list
with announcements about new releases of GIMP and plug-ins.  Gimp-developer is 
oriented to GIMP core and plug-in developers.  Most people will only want to 
be subscribed to gimp-user. If you want to help develop The GIMP, the
gimp-developer mailing list is a good starting point.

3. IRC
======

And finally, for the real junkies, there is an IRC channel devoted to
the GIMP. On Byxnet (a private mostly-GIMP network) there is #gimp.
Many of the developers hang out there.  One of the Byxnet servers are:

	irc.gimp.org:6667

4. Customizing
==============

The look of GIMP's interface can be customized like any other GTK app
by editing the ~/.gtkrc file or by using "themes" (ready-made 
customizations). For downloadable themes and further details, see
http://gtk.themes.org. Additionally GIMP reads ~/.gimp-1.1/gtkrc so you 
can have settings that only apply to The GIMP.

Included is a set of keybindings similar to those in Adobe Photoshop (tm).
You can find them in the ps-menurc file.  To use them, copy this file to
~/.gimp-1.1/menurc. You can also manually change the keybindings to any of
your choice by editing ~/.gimp-1.1/menurc.

5. Bugs
=======

We sincerely hope you enjoy the program.  Please report problems to
bugs@gimp.org.  Before reporting a problem, you may want to see if someone
else did already - check http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgimp.html for this.

Have fun,
