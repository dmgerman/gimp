#
# this file controls which files get mirrored from/to
# the sourceforge gimp-plug-ins cvs tree
#
# the syntax is easy, below are files/directories, with
# a prefix character that specifies the action that should be done to it:
#
# M	mirror the file/dir from the gimp cvs to the plug-in cvs.
#       these are the files that go _TO_ the gimp-plug-in server
#
# U	update the file/dir from the plug-in cvs to the main gimp cvs.
#	these are the files that come _FROM_ the plug-in cvs server
#
# I	simply ignore the file/dir (it is not moved between the cvs trees)
#	these are the files that are in only one cvs tree
#
# C	a comment for the following line
#
# * Later entries in the list take precedence over earlier ones.
# * File deletes do not get mirrored. Damn!
# * Directories should end in a trailing slash.
#
# NOTE: If anything goes havoc, then just delete this file from cvs
# the mirror script will NOT try to do anything when this file is missing
#
