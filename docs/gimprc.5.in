.SH NAME
gimprc \- gimp configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gimprc
file is a configuation file read by the GIMP when it starts up.  There
are two of these: one system-wide one stored in
@gimpsysconfdir@/gimprc and a per-user \fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/gimprc
which may override system settings.

Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue until the end
of the line.  Blank lines are ignored.

The
.B gimprc
file associates values with properties.  These properties may be set
by lisp-like assignments of the form:
.IP
\f3(\f2property-name\ value\f3)\f1
.TP
where:
.TP 10
.I property-name
is one of the property names described below.
.TP
.I value
is the value the property is to be set to.
.PP

Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the name from the value.
.PP
.SH PROPERTIES
Valid properties and their default values are:

.TP
(temp-path "${gimp_dir}/tmp")

Sets the temporary storage directory. Files will appear here during the course
of running the GIMP.  Most files will disappear when the GIMP exits, but some
files are likely to remain, so it is best if this directory not be one that is
shared by other users.  This is a single folder.

.TP
(swap-path "${gimp_dir}")

Sets the swap file location. The gimp uses a tile based memory allocation
scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and
back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if the GIMP is
used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is
created on a directory that is mounted over NFS.  For these reasons, it may be
desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".  This is a single folder.

.TP
(stingy-memory-use no)

There is always a tradeoff between memory usage and speed.  In most cases, the
GIMP opts for speed over memory.  However, if memory is a big issue, try to
enable this setting.  Possible values are yes and no.

.TP
(num-processors 1)

On multiprocessor machines, if GIMP has been compiled with --enable-mp this
sets how many processors GIMP should use simultaneously.  This is an integer
value.

.TP
(tile-cache-size 64M)

The tile cache is used to make sure the GIMP doesn't thrash tiles between
memory and disk. Setting this value higher will cause the GIMP to use less
swap space, but will also cause the GIMP to use more memory. Conversely, a
smaller cache size causes the GIMP to use more swap space and less memory. 
The integer size can contain a suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP
interpret the size as being specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or
gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the size defaults to being specified in
kilobytes.

.TP
(interpolation-type linear)

Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and other transformations. 
Possible values are none, linear and cubic.

.TP

Sets the module search path.  This is a colon-separated list of folders to
search.

.TP
(environ-path "${gimp_dir}/environ:${gimp_plug_in_dir}/environ")

Sets the environ search path.  This is a colon-separated list of folders to
search.

.TP
(brush-path "${gimp_dir}/brushes:${gimp_data_dir}/brushes")

Sets the brush search path.  This is a colon-separated list of folders to
search.

.TP
(pattern-path "${gimp_dir}/patterns:${gimp_data_dir}/patterns")

Sets the pattern search path.  This is a colon-separated list of folders to
search.

.TP
(palette-path "${gimp_dir}/palettes:${gimp_data_dir}/palettes")

Sets the palette search path.  This is a colon-separated list of folders to
search.

.TP
(gradient-path "${gimp_dir}/gradients:${gimp_data_dir}/gradients")

Sets the gradient search path.  This is a colon-separated list of folders to
search.

.TP
(font-path "${gimp_dir}/fonts:${gimp_data_dir}/fonts")

Where to look for fonts.  This is a colon-separated list of folders to search.

will be used for coordinate display when not in dot-for-dot mode.  The unit
can be one inches, millimeters, points or picas plus those in your user units
database.

.TP
(default-xresolution 72.000000)

Sets the default horizontal resolution for new images and for the "File/New"
dialog. This value is always in dpi (dots per inch).  This is a float value.

kept available until the undo-size limit is reached.  This is an integer
value.

.TP
(undo-size 1024k)

Sets an upper limit to the memory that is used per image to keep operations on
the undo stack.  The integer size can contain a suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G'
which makes GIMP interpret the size as being specified in bytes, kilobytes,
megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the size defaults to being
specified in kilobytes.

.TP
(pluginrc-path "${gimp_dir}/pluginrc")

Sets the pluginrc search path.  This is a single filename.

.TP
(layer-previews yes)

Sets whether GIMP should create previews of layers and channels. Previews in
the layers and channels dialog are nice to have but they can slow things down
when working with large images.  Possible values are yes and no.

tiny, extra-small, small, medium, large, extra-large, huge, enormous and
gigantic.

This setting is ignored.  This is a float value.

.TP
(install-colormap no)

Generally only a concern for 8-bit displays, this sets the minimum number of
system colors allocated for the GIMP.  This is an integer value.

.TP
(marching-ants-speed 300)

Speed of marching ants in the selection outline.  This value is in
milliseconds (less time indicates faster marching).  This is an integer value.

.TP
(colormap-cycling no)

cycling as opposed to be drawn as animated lines.  This color cycling option
works only with 8-bit displays.  Possible values are yes and no.

.TP
(resize-windows-on-zoom no)

When enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself, when zooming
into and out of images.  Possible values are yes and no.

.TP
(resize-windows-on-resize no)

When enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself, whenever the
physical image size changes.  Possible values are yes and no.

pixel on the screen.  Possible values are yes and no.

.TP

When enabled, this will ensure that the full image is visible after a file is
opened, otherwise it will be displayed with a scale of 1:1.  Possible values
are yes and no.

.TP
(perfect-mouse no)

When enabled, the X server is queried for the mouse's current position on each
motion event, rather than relying on the position hint.  This means painting
with large brushes should be more accurate, but it may be slower.  Perversely,
on some X servers enabling this option results in faster painting.  Possible
values are yes and no.

.TP
(cursor-mode tool-icon)

Sets the mode of cursor the GIMP will use.  Possible values are tool-icon,
tool-crosshair and crosshair.

.TP

outline.  Possible values are yes and no.

.SH PATH EXPANSION
Strings of type PATH are expanded in a manner similar to

There are a few variables that are pre-defined:
.TP
.I gimp_dir
The personal gimp directory which is set to the value of the environment
variable GIMP2_DIRECTORY or to ~/@gimpdir@.
.TP
.I gimp_data_dir
Nase for paths to shareable data, which is set to the value of the
environment variable GIMP2_DATADIR or to the compiled-in default value
@gimpdatadir@.
.TP
.I gimp_plug_in_dir
Base to paths for architecture-specific plugins and modules, which is set
to the value of the environment variable GIMP2_PLUGINDIR or to the
compiled-in default value @gimpplugindir@.
