Gimp I* Hose Format

	The gih format is use to store a series of pixmap brushes,
and some extra info for how to use them. 

Basically, the format is real simple. It is a text header, followed
by a series of gpb files, all concatenated together.

The header format
================

First line is the name of the hose.
Second line is the number of brushes in file

ie
===========================
Fire
6
===========================

The rest is just gpb files catted in.

Making a gih file:

	1. Create a series of gpb files. Note these do not
	need to be the same size.

	2. Create a text header like above.

	3. Combine them all together:

		cat header brush1.gpb brush2.gpb brush3.gpb > foo.gih


Thats about it for now.


Other bits:
==========

The spacing for the hose is currently based on the spacing
for the last brush in the hose. 

WARNING:
=======

The header file format, and possible the entire file format
is likely to change.
