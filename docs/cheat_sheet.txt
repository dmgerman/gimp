All selections (rectangular, ellipse, fuzzy, magic wand)

		mb1			draw selection
	
		mb1+mb3 (release mb1)	cancel selection
	
	At inital click	
	
		shift+mb1	       	Add selection to existing selection	
	
		ctrl+mb1	        subtract selection from existing selection
	
		shift+ctrl+mb1		 keep part of selection in both selections (union)
		
	on active selections
	
		alt+mb1			move selection


ellipse and rectangular selection
	
	while making selection

		shift+mb1	        constrain selection to regular shape (square/circle)
	
		ctrl+mb1	        draw selection centered from click
	
		ctrl+shift+mb1          draw (square/circle) selection centered on click
		

	Tool Options
	
		Antialiasing     ???
		
		Feather		Turns on feathering (similar to blurring a selection mask)
				Used to make a "smoother" selection
							  
		Feather Radius   Determines the blur radius of the selection mask.
							  How smooth the selection needs to be.
							  
							  
Magic Wand selection

	(all the general selection addition rules apply)
	
	Tool Options
	
		Sample Merged   If off, just use the contents of the current drawable

Bezier Select

	While making selection
	
		mb1		sets the control points
		
	To make bezier into a selection
	
		close the selection (beziers have to be closed), then click
		inside the selection. Zooming in sometimes helps.
			
	After closing bezier (but before making a selection)
	
		mb1 on control point 	adjust handles
		shift+mb1		adjust one handle
		ctrl+mb1		move the point

				     of the inital pixel, they are filled

		Mode		    What paint mode to use

		Offset		at what percentage fo the gradient to start from (ie, 50
				to start the blend at halfway through the gradient)

		Mode		What paint mode to apply the blend with

			bi-linear			like linear but "mirrored" across the inital point

			Radial				blends radial form point A being the center to point
							B being a point on the circumference.

			Square				makes a sqaured shaped blend from a center at Point A
							to point B on the perimeter

			conical				????
			conical
				(asymeteric)	????

							if off, blend does no supersampling resulting
							in a much faster blend
			
			Max Depth.			???
			Threshold			???
			

Pencil

	mb1(hold)		draw with pencil tool
	alt+mb1(hold)		draw with pencil tool, but store all of the cursor history
				events (so you can draw fast and let it catch up with you
				without losing info)
	
	shift+mb1		draw a straigtline from the last place the cursor was
	
	
Paintbrush

	mb1(hold)		draw with paintbrush tool
	alt+mb1(hold)		draw with paintbrush tool, but store all of the cursor history
				events (so you can draw fast and let it catch up with you
				without losing info)
	
	shift+mb1		draw a straigtline from the last place the cursor was
		 
	Tool Options
	
		Fade Out		distance you can paint before the paint "runs out"
					set to 0 for unlimeted "paint"
						
Eraser

	mb1(hold)		erase (set to transparent or background color)
	alt+mb1(hold)		erase but store all of the cursor history
				events (so you can erase fast and let it catch up with you
				without losing info)
	shift+mb1		erase a straightline from the last place the cursor was
	

Airbrush

	
	mb1(hold)		draw with airbrush tool
	alt+mb1(hold)		draw with airbrush tool, but store all of the cursor history
				events (so you can draw fast and let it catch up with you
				without losing info)
	
	shift+mb1		draw a straigtline from the last place the cursor was
		 
	Tool Options
	
		Rate			Controls how quickly the "paint flows". Higher values 
					reach full value quicker
						
		Pressure		the higher the value, the quicker the airbrush fills the brush
		

Clone Tool


	mb1(hold)		draw with the clone tool	
	ctrl+mb1		set the point from which the brush clones							  
	alt+mb1(hold)		draw with clone tool, but store all of the cursor history
				events (so you can draw fast and let it catch up with you

		tries to keep the source point and the cloned point "in sync" YMMV
		if for pattern source, having alligned on means the clone tool
