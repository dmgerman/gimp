# causes the gimp to use more swap space and less memory.
# Note: the gimp will still run even if `tile-cache-size' is
# set to 0. The actual size can contain a suffix of 'm', 'M',
# 'k', 'K', 'b' or 'B', which makes the gimp interpret the
# size as being specified in megabytes, kilobytes and bytes
