# The variable ${gimp_dir} is set to the value of the environment variable

# Sets the temporary storage directory. Files will appear here during the
# course of running the GIMP.  Most files will disappear when the GIMP exits,
# but some files are likely to remain, so it is best if this directory not be
# one that is shared by other users.  This is a single folder.
# 
# (temp-path "${gimp_dir}/tmp")

# Sets the swap file location. The gimp uses a tile based memory allocation
# scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk
# and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if the
# GIMP is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the
# swap file is created on a directory that is mounted over NFS.  For these
# reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".  This is a
# single folder.

# There is always a tradeoff between memory usage and speed.  In most cases,

# On multiprocessor machines, if GIMP has been compiled with --enable-mp this

# The tile cache is used to make sure the GIMP doesn't thrash tiles between
# memory and disk. Setting this value higher will cause the GIMP to use less
# swap space, but will also cause the GIMP to use more memory. Conversely, a
# smaller cache size causes the GIMP to use more swap space and less memory. 
# The integer size can contain a suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes
# GIMP interpret the size as being specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes
# or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the size defaults to being
