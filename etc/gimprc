# This is the system-wide gimprc file.  Any change made in this file
# will affect all users of this system, provided that they are not

# Lines that start with a '#' are comments. Blank lines are ignored.

# By default everything in this file is commented out. The file then
# documents the default values and shows what changes are possible.

# The variable ${gimp_dir} is set to the value of the environment
# variable GIMP_DIRECTORY or, if that is not set, the compiled-in
# default value is used. If GIMP_DIRECTORY is not an absolute path,
# it is interpreted relative to your home directory.

# Sets the temporary storage directory. Files will appear here during the
# course of running the GIMP.  Most files will disappear when the GIMP exits,
# but some files are likely to remain, such as working palette files, so it
# is best if this directory not be one that is shared by other users or is
# cleared on machine reboot such as /tmp.  This is a single folder.
#
# (temp-path "${gimp_dir}/tmp")

# Sets the swap file location. The gimp uses a tile based memory allocation
# scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk
# and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if the
# GIMP is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the
# swap file is created on a directory that is mounted over NFS.  For these
# reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".  This is a
# single folder.
#
# (swap-path "${gimp_dir}")

# There is always a tradeoff between memory usage and speed.  In most cases,
# the GIMP opts for speed over memory.  However, if memory is a big issue,
# set stingy-memory-use to yes.  Possible values are yes and no.
#
# (stingy-memory-use no)

# On multiprocessor machines, if GIMP has been compiled with --enable-mp this
# sets how many processors GIMP should use simultaneously.  This is an
# integer value.
#
# (num-processors 1)

# The tile cache is used to make sure the GIMP doesn't thrash tiles between
# memory and disk. Setting this value higher will cause the GIMP to use less
# swap space, but will also cause the GIMP to use more memory. Conversely, a
# smaller cache size causes the GIMP to use more swap space and less memory. 
# The integer size can contain a suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes
# GIMP interpret the size as being specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes
# or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the size defaults to being
# specified in kilobytes.
