.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIGIMP\fP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is used to edit and
manipulate images. It can load and save a variety of image formats and can
be used to convert between formats. 
.PP
Gimp can also be used as a paint program. It features a set of drawing and 
painting tools such as airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint brush. Painting 
and drawing tools can be applied to an image with a variety of paint modes.
It also offers an extensive array of selection tools like
rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select,
intelligent scissors, and select by color.  
.PP
Gimp offers a variety of plugins that perform a variety of image manipulations.
Examples include bumpmap, edge detect, gaussian blur, and many others. 
.PP
In addition, Gimp has several scripting extension which allow for advanced
non-interactive processing and creation of images. 
.SH OPTIONS
.l 
The \fIgimp\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-h, \-\-help
Display a list of all commandline options.
.TP 8
.B \-v, \-\-version
Output the version info.
.TP 8
.B \-b, \-\-batch \fI<commands>\fP
Execute the set of \fI<commands>\fP non-interactively. The set
of \fI<commands>\fP is typically in the form of a script that
can be executed by one of the Gimp scripting extensions.
.TP 8
.B \-g, \-\-gimprc \fI<gimprc>\fP
Use an alternative gimprc instead of the default one. Useful in
cases where plugins paths or machine specs may be different.
.TP 8
.B \-n, \-\-no-interface
Run without a user interface.
.TP 8
.B \-r, \-\-restore\-session
Try to restore saved session.
.TP 8
.B \-\-no\-data
Do not load patterns, gradients, palettes, or brushes. Often useful
in non-interactive situations where startup time is to be minimized.
.TP 8
.B \-\-verbose
Show startup messages.
.TP 8 
.B \-\-no\-shm
Do not use shared memory between GIMP and its plugins. 
Instead of using shared memory, GIMP will send the data via pipe. This
will result in slower performance than using shared memory.
.TP 8
.B \-\-no\-xshm
Do not use the X Shared Memory extension. If GIMP is being displayed
on a remote X server, this probably needs to be enabled. Also useful
for any X server that doesn't properly support the X shared memory extension.
This will result in slower performance than with X shared memory enabled.
.TP 8
.B \-\-display \fIdisplay\fP
Use the designated X display.
.TP 8
.B \-\-no\-splash
Do not show the splash screen.
.TP 8
.B \-\-no\-splash\-image
Do not show the splash screen image as part of the splash screen.
.TP 8
.B \-\-debug\-handlers
Enable debugging signal handlers.
.TP 8
.B \-\-console\-messages
Do not popup dialog boxes on errors or warnings. Print the messages on
the console instead.
.TP 8
.B \-\-system\-gimprc \fI<gimprc>\fP
Use an alternate system gimprc file.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
.SH FILES

Gimp's data files are stored in @gimpdatadir@, where ${prefix} 
is set on install, but is typically /usr/local. 
Most gimp configuration is read in from the users init file,
\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/gimprc. The system wide equivalent is in
@gimpdatadir@/gimprc. The system wide file is parsed 
first and the user gimprc can override the sytem settings. 
@gimpdatadir@/gimprc_user is the default gimprc
placed in users home directories the first time gimp is ran.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/gtkrc - users set of gimp-specific GTK 
config settings. Options such as widget color and fonts sizes 
can be set here.

@gimpdatadir@/gtkrc - sytem wide default set of gimp-specific 
GTK config settings.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/ideas - lists all images that have been 
opened or saved using Gimp.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/menurc - user's set of keybindings.

@gimpdatadir@/menurc - system wide set of keybindings.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/parasiterc - Description of all available 
gimp parasites. This is file is recreated everytime gimp starts up.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/sessionrc - This file takes session-specific info 
(that is info, you want to keep between two gimp-sessions). You are
not supposed to edit it manually, but of course you
can do. This file will be entirely rewritten every time
you quit the gimp. If this file isn't found, defaults are used.

@gimpdatadir@/unitrc - default user unit database. It
contains the unit definitions for centimeters, meters, feet, yards,
typographic points and typographic picas and is placed in users home
directories the first time the gimp is ran.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/unitrc - This file contains your user unit 
database. You can modify this list with the unit editor. You are 
not supposed to edit it manually, but of course you can do.
This file will be entirely rewritten every time you
quit the gimp.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/plug-ins - location of user installed plugins.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/pluginrc - plugin initialization values are stored
here. This file is parsed on startup and regenerated if need be.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/modules - location of user installed modules.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/tmp - default location that gimp uses as temporary 
space.

@gimpdatadir@/brushes - system wide brush files.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/brushes - user created and installed brush
files. These files are in the .gbr (gimp brush) format.

from the brush dialog. These files are in the .vbr (gimp vector brush) 
format.

and papers are stored here.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/levels - Level profiles and presets as saved from 
the Levels tool.

@gimpdatadir@/palettes - the system wide palette files. The 
files are copied to the user palettes directory when gimp is first ran
to allow the user to modify the palettes. This directory is not searched 
for palettes by default.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/palettes - copies of the system palette files as well as
user created and modified palette files.

@gimpdatadir@/patterns - basic set of patterns for use in 
gimp.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/patterns - user created and installed gimp pattern
files. This files are in the .pat format.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/gflares - user created and installed gflare files.

gfig plug-in.

\fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/gfig - user created and installed gfig files.

with tips in other languages.

.SH SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS
Any bugs found should be reported to the Gimp Developer mailing list
at gimp-developer@xcf.berkeley.edu or you may want to make use
of the online bug-tracking system available on the web at
http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgimp.html or submit a bug report
to the system via http://www.xach.com/gimp/news/bugreport.html

Before reporting bugs, please check to see if the bug is mentioned 
in the FAQ's or the mailing list archive. See the section on Other 
Info for locations of these.

When reporting Gimp bugs, it is important to include a
reliable way to reproduce the bug, version number of Gimp (and
probably GTK), OS name and version, and any relevant hardware
specs. It is also very important to include as much info as possible 
about the Xserver the problem was found on including at least server 
name, the visual, and the bit depth.

If a bug is causing a crash, it is very useful if a stack trace 
can be provided. And of course, patches to rectify the bug are even
better.

.SH OTHER INFO

The canonical place to find GIMP info is at http://www.gimp.org/.
Here you can find links to just about every other gimp site, tutorials, data 
sets, mailing list archives, and more.

There is also a Gimp User Manual available at
