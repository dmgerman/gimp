    $help = <<HELP;
This procedure loads the specified help page into the helpbrowser or
what ever is configured as help viewer. The help page is identified by
its domain and ID: if help_domain is NULL, we use the help_domain
which was registered using the gimp-plugin-help-register procedure. If
help_domain is NULL and no help domain was registered, the help domain
of the main GIMP installation is used.
