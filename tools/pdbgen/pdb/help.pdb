This procedure loads the specified help page into the helpbrowser or what ever
is configured as help viewer. The location of the help page is given relative 
to the help rootdir. The help rootdir is determined from the prog_name: if
prog_name is NULL, we use the help rootdir of the main GIMP installation,
if the plug-in's full executable name is passed as prog_name, the GIMP
will use this information to look up the help path the plug-in has registered
before with gimp-plugin-help-register.
