sub drawable_merge_shadow {
    $blurb = 'Merge the shadow buffer with the specified drawable.';

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure combines the contents of the image's shadow buffer (for
temporary processing) with the specified drawable. The "undo" parameter
specifies whether to add an undo step for the operation. Requesting no undo is
useful for such applications as 'auto-apply'.

sub drawable_fill {

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure fills the drawable with the fill mode. If the fill mode is
foreground the current foreground color is used. If the fill mode is
background, the current background color is used. If the fill type is white,
then white is used. Transparent fill only affects layers with an alpha channel,
in which case the alpha channel is set to transparent. If the drawable has no
alpha channel, it is filled to white. No fill leaves the drawable's contents
undefined. This procedure is unlike the bucket fill tool because it fills
regardless of a selection
