This procedure determines the region of the specified drawable that lies

This procedure sharpens the selection mask. For every pixel in the selection

Transfer the specified layer's alpha channel to the selection mask.
BLURB

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure requires a layer with an alpha channel. The alpha channel
information is used to create a selection mask such that for any pixel in the
image defined in the specified layer, that layer pixel's alpha value is
transferred to the selection mask. If the layer is undefined at a particular
image pixel, the associated selection mask value is set to 0.

This procedure loads the specified channel into the selection mask. This
essentially involves a copy of the channel's content in to the selection mask.
Therefore, the channel must have the same width and height of the image, or an
