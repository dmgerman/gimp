	* gcg.c: When built on Win32 with gcc, don't use popen,
	as it doesn't seem to work when gcc is itself running under
	cygwin, but gcg is not.

	* makefile.cygwin: New file.

	* Makefile.am: Distribute it.

Wed Jan 20 20:46:39 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* AUTHORS
	* NEWS: satisfy automake

	* gcg.c: braces around ambiguous if

Wed Jan 13 16:03:47 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

        * Makefile.am: grr, some cc's barf if the search dir doesn't
        exist, leave $(datadir)/gcg out for now

Sat Jan  9 22:44:03 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: call configure again

	* gcg.c
	* Makefile.am: use CPP_SEARCH for finding stuff

Sat Jan  9 16:00:22 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: pass -x c to gcc so it doesn't try to
	pass the .gc files as linker input

	* Makefile.am: use builtin automake rules for yacc/lex

Thu Jan  7 15:50:21 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* gcg.c: use CPP_PROGRAM instead of hardcoding "cpp"

1999-01-07  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Took out configure from autogen.sh

1999-01-05  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Fixed the parser and lexer a bit, changed naming conventions
	here and there.

Mon Dec 21 21:56:58 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* fixed up ex for latest glib/gtk+

1998-11-21  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Added signal demarshallers. Currently they are generated for
	each module (= compilation unit) separately, which is bound to
	cause some code duplication..

	* Added import headers and some more example stuff.

	* It actually runs now, with a zillion caveats, but anyway..
	Still have to do lotsa things for serious use..

1998-11-20  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Again modified the formatting stuff. Some preliminary header
	stuff. Soon moving to use cpp..

1998-11-18  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Signal marshalling should be pretty complete now. Demarshalling
	isn't quite yet, though..

1998-11-17  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Misc enhancements.

1998-11-14  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Changed lotsa internal stuff. Started work on signal wrappers
	and marshallers. 

1998-10-24  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Redid the backend. It takes more time and memory now, but should 
	  be a bit more flexible, and type safe.

1998-10-22  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* A bit more method generation

1998-10-21  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Added vfunc wrappers and accessors
	
1998-10-21  Lauri Alanko  <la@iki.fi>

	* Initially committed to CVS
