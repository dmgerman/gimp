Developers documentation 
------------------------

The goal is to provide useful source documentation. Right 
now this is limited to libgimp since that is the part that 
is by third-party coders (plug-in developers). Other parts
of the code may follow later, but not before libgimp is 
properly documented.


Principle
---------
The documentation is extracted out of the source using 
gtk-doc. We use a combination of comment blocks embedded 
into the source and additional information added manually 
into the SGML files. It is planned to extract useful 
inforamtion about the PDB wrappers out of the PDB 
(probably using pdbgen).


Requirements
------------
GIMP releases will contain a complete set of HTML files and
the SGML files to create other formats. You will only need
gtk-doc if you want to work on the documentation itself. 
In that case you will need the following utilities:

Perl v5 - the main scripts are in Perl.

DocBook DTD v3.0 - This is the DocBook SGML DTD.
    http://www.ora.com/davenport

Jade v1.1 - This is a DSSSL processor for converting SGML 
    to various formats. 
    http://www.jclark.com/jade

Modular DocBook Stylesheets (v1.19+ should be OK)
    This is the DSSSL code to convert DocBook to HTML (and 
    a few other formats). It's used together with jade.

gtk-doc - This package automatically generates DocBook 
    documentation for GTK+ and converts the DocBook 
    documentation into HTML (and man pages in future).

HOWTO
-----
Carefully read the README that comes with gtk-doc. Then 
read it again. Once you think you really understood how 
it is supposed to work, fill in this chapter.
