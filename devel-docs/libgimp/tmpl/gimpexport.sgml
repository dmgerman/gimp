<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Export an image before it is saved.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
This function should be called by all save_plugins unless they are
able to save all image formats the GIMP knows about. It takes care
of asking the user if she wishes to export the image to a format the
save_plugin can handle. It then performs the necessary conversions
(e.g. Flatten) on a copy of the image so that the image can be saved 
without changing the original image.

The capabilities of the save_plugin are specified by combining
#GimpExportCapabilities using a bitwise OR. 

Make sure you have initialized GTK+ before you call this function
as it will most probably have to open a dialog.

                   all image_types.
@CAN_HANDLE_LAYERS: Use if the plugin can save multiple layers.
@CAN_HANDLE_LAYERS_AS_ANIMATION: Use if the plugin can save multiple layers
                                 but treats them as frames in an animation.

@EXPORT_CANCEL: The user chose Cancel in the export dialog. The plugin should
                terminate itself.
@EXPORT_IGNORE: The user chose Ignore in the export dialog. No conversion is 
                performed and the plugin should try to save as usual.
@EXPORT_EXPORT: The user chose Export in the export dialog. A copy of the 
                image is created and then converted to fit the needs of the 
                plugin. The plugin has to take care of deleting the copy when
		it has finished saving it.
