There are a few environment variables, options or other more-or-less
known tricks to debug GIMP. Let's try to add them here for reminder and
newcomers.

## Basics ##

The basic thing is to build babl, GEGL and GIMP with `--enable-debug`.

Note that if you also built glib from source with `--enable-debug`,
every GObject destroyed are apparently overwritten with values invalid
as pointers, so dereferencing one after destruction usually leads to a
crash, which is a good way to find some more vicious bugs.

## Debug logs ##

You can see various GIMP_LOG() calls in the code. These will only be
outputted when you set GIMP_DEBUG environment variable to a
comma-separated list of domain.
For instance, for `GIMP_LOG (XCF, "some string")` to be outputted,
run GIMP like this:

> GIMP_DEBUG=xcf gimp-2.9

Special flags are:
- "all" to output all domain logs;
- "list-all" to get a list of available domains.

## Debugging a warning ##

If you encounter a CRITICAL or WARNING message on console, you can make
so that GIMP crashes on it, which will make it very easy to be tracked
down in a debugger (for instance GDB), by running GIMP with:

> gimp-2.9 --g-fatal-warnings

## Debugging GEGL code ##

You may encounter this kind of warning upon exiting GIMP:

> EEEEeEeek! 2 GeglBuffers leaked

To debug GeglBuffer leaks, set the environment variable GEGL_DEBUG to
"buffer-alloc".

## Debugging babl ##

Profile conversion is done with babl by default when possible, which is
much faster.
Setting GIMP_COLOR_TRANSFORM_DISABLE_BABL environment variable switch
back to the old lcms implementation, which can be useful for comparison.

## Debugging X Window System error ##

Make X calls synchronous so that your crashs happen immediately with:

> gimp-2.9 --sync

You can also break on `gdk_x_error()`.

## Debugging icons ##

See file `devel-docs/icons.txt` to learn more about our icons, and in
particular the environment variable GIMP_ICONS_LIKE_A_BOSS.

## Debugging plug-ins ##

See file `devel-docs/debug-plug-ins.txt` for usage of environment
variable GIMP_PLUGIN_DEBUG.
