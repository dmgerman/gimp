# The tile cache is used to make sure the gimp doesn't thrash

#  causes the gimp to use more swap space and less memory.
#  Note: the gimp will still run even if `tile-cache-size' is
#  set to 0. The actual size can contain a suffix of 'm', 'M',
#  'k', 'K', 'b' or 'B', which makes the gimp interpret the
#  size as being specified in megabytes, kilobytes and bytes

# Set the minimal number of colors for dithering on 8-bit displays.
#  If the GIMP cannot allocate at least this number of colors, a
#  private colormap will be allocated, resulting in colormap "flashing".
#  The default value of 144 corresponds to a "color cube" of 6*6*4 colors
#  where the 3 values stand for shades of red, green and blue.
#  Multiplying the # of shades of each primary color yields
#  the total number of colors that will be allocated for the
#  GIMP colormap.
#  This number must not exceed 256.  Most of the colors remaining after
#  the allocation of the colorcube will be left to the system palette
#  in an effort to reduce colormap "flashing".
#  Note that setting this value to something higher than 216 (6*6*6)

#
# One important item to keep in mind:  Many images that you might
#  get from outside sources will in all likelihood already be
#  gamma-corrected.  In these cases, the image will look washed-out
#  if the gimp has gamma-correction turned on.  If you are going

# Perfect mouse tracking
#  GIMP attempts to keep up with the motion of the pointer when
#  painting, but when a painting operation is particularly CPU
#  intensive the GIMP will miss the subtlety of your painting
#  motion and render overly-angular strokes.  Enabling 'perfect
#  mouse tracking' allows GIMP to track your painting motion
#  more evenly, at the expense of lagging behind your brush at
#  times of CPU stress.
