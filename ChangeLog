	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb:

	Two of the gimp-perl scripts used to call gimp_layer_delete() after
	gimp_image_remove_layer(). This will fail since the layer is already 
	scheduled for destruction by removing it from the associated image or
	by deleting that image. It is thus dangerous and superfluous to export
	this feature through the PDB. The gimp_layer_delete() is hereby
	obsolete and does nothing any longer. I have removed the code calling
	it from all over the place (it was commented out in almost all places).

	The PDB help for gimp_channel_delete() now explicetly tells the user 
	about the proper usage of the procedure.

	* app/bezier_select.[ch]
	* app/bezier_selectP.h: massive cleanup (prototypes, indentation, ...)

2000-12-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: cleanup, proper prototypes, ...

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: the size of the string holding the
	image data was one byte too short (we forgot the trailing '\0').

	* TODO.xml
	* docs/make-todo: new files. TODO.xml is a first start on a roadmap
	towards gimp-1.4. All new features and major changes need to be 
	defined here to be accepted into the gimp-1.3 branch.

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: gimp_image_merge_layers(): apply the layer mask
	only if layer->apply_mask is TRUE, cleanup.

	* plug-ins/mosaic/mosaic.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/textured-logo.scm
	Implemented a toggle to ask the user, if he wants to allow some
	tiles to be split in two pieces. This enables perfect hexagonal/
	squared/octagonal tiles. Changed the PDB-Interface and changed the
	script using this plug-in.

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: implemented gimp_image_get_layer_by_index(),
	small cleanups.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: use the new function instead of accessing
	the layer list directly.

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: layers_dialog_scroll_index(): don't fiddle
	around with magic numbers when calculating the layer widget's
	height but simply ask one of them for it's allocation.  Fixes
	positioning when the preview is smaller than the layer widget list
	item.

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose_storage.c: Remove the last comma in
	  an enum, xlc barfs
