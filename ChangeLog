2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_initialize_after_callback): select the
	standard tool.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: cosmetics.

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c: reverted fix for bug #141930. These
	hacks are there because the enum used in levels doesn't match
	the enum used by the combo box and the histogram widget.

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c (gimp_clone_tool_button_release):
	removed again (tools must not draw outside GimpDrawTool::draw()).

	(gimp_clone_tool_draw): removed check for gimp_draw_tool_is_active()
	because the draw function would not be called if the draw tool was
	inactive. Simplified check for whether or not to draw the src
	location.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c (gimp_paint_tool_button_release):
	pause/resume the draw tool across all button_release actions so
	tools (clone) have a chance to draw different things depending on
	gimp_tool_control_is_active(tool->control). Fixes bug #145022.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_select_object): added missing
	return value.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: applied HIG rules to the GUI and slightly
	rearranged it to get a more compact layout. Applied GIMP coding
	style.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable.c: removed wrong note about using
	_gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable() from the API docs.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c (dog): ifdef'ed out calls to
	_gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable() since it can't be used from a
	plug-in. Removed trailing whitespace and redundant includes.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: removed _gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable again.

2004-06-28  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: fixed drawing code to properly
	update after deleting nodes via BackSpace/Delete.

2004-06-27  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c: removed two small chunks of code.
	Fixes bug #141930.  Possibly unfixes bug #132322.
	
2004-06-27  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def: added _gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable because
	it is used in a plug-in. See bug #145051.

2004-06-26  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: Preview now works correctly with
	RGBA and grayscale-alpha images. Fixes bug #144971.

2004-06-26  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c: added button_release callback
	to fix bug #145022.
	
2004-06-26  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: Use GTK_PREVIEW_GRAYSCALE if source
	is grayscale or grayscale-alpha. Partial fix for bug #144971.

2004-06-25  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: speed up preview by allocating tile
	cache before creating dialog.  Should fix bug #144972.
	
2004-06-25  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/zealouscrop.c: Moved Zealous Crop from
	<Image>/Layer/Crop to <Image>/Image/Crop because it affects the
	entire image.

2004-06-25  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: added Difference of Gaussians edge
	detect plug-in.

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl:
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: added dog and regenerated
	Makefile.
	
2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c: added GIMP_ACTION_SELECT_SET
	actions which set a generated brush's properties directly.

	* app/actions/context-commands.c: adjust the range of possible
	brush radius and aspect_ratio values to be actually usable.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.[ch]: reordered parameters and
	members to be consistent with other places where generated
	brushes are used. Check for errors when loading a brush and
	utf8-validate its name. Cleanup.

	* app/core/gimpbrush.c
	* app/core/gimpbrushpipe.c: cleanup.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_dialog_new): work around
	GTK+ bug #143270 (set the cursor on the selected model path
	instead of selecting the iter in the selection). Fixes random
	theme switching when selecting the "Theme" page.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.c: added properties for all brush
	parameters.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c: listen to property changes of the
	edited brush and update the scales accordingly.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: more work on the controller page,
	made integer controller properties editable.

	* modules/controller_midi.c: allow to specify the MIDI channel to
	generate events from. Default to -1 (all channels).

2004-06-24  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.[ch]:
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.c: Let gfig use a thumbnail of the
	image as background for its preview, if the image is RGB and "Show 
	image" is checked in the Options tab.  (Next best thing to 
	previewing in the image.)
	
2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: added a boolean property
	"debug-events" and honor it when printing debugging output.
	Should add an event console window so the user doesn't need to
	have a terminal to inspect input module output.

	* app/gui/prefereces-dialog.c: HIGified some forgotten labels.
	Renamed the "Pointer Movement Feedback" frame to "Mouse Cursors".
	Replaced some forgotten "Dir" with "Folder".
	Made more GimpControllerInfo and GimpController properties
	editable and cleaned up the controller page.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.[ch]: added gimp_prop_label_new().

	* app/widgets/gimpgrideditor.c: HIGified capitalization.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c
	* modules/controller_midi.c: remember the source ID returned by
	g_io_add_watch() and remove it when changing the device, so the
	file descritor gets actually closed. Minor cleanups.

2004-06-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.[ch]: renamed function
	gimp_controller_wheel_scrolled() to
	gimp_controller_wheel_scroll().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): changed accordingly.

2004-06-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: return TRUE if the key event was handled.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c: removed key_press() implementation.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerkeyboard.[ch]: new controller class
	which takes GdkEventKey and emits controller events for all
	combinations of modifiers and cursor keys.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_controllers_get_keyboard().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: if a key event was not
	handled by the active tool, dispatch it to the keyboard controller.

	* etc/controllerrc: add a keyboard controller which is configured
	to do the same as the removed gimp_paint_tool_key_press().

2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable.c:  added some documentation for
	a few important functions with no API docs.
	
2004-06-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.1.1 release.

2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/actions/file-commands.c: make "Revert" only ask for 
	confirmation if image is dirty.  Fixes bug #141971.
	
2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/gui/*.c:
	* app/widgets/*.c:
	* etc/templaterc: HIGify capitalization.  Should finish bug #123699
	except for everything I missed or got wrong.
	
2004-06-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* etc/controllerrc: commented out the linux_input controller
	configuration.

2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/*.c: HIGify capitalization for dialogs.  More
	progress on bug #123699.
	
2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_midi.c: added utility function midi_event()
	which assembles a GimpControllerEventValue and emits it.

2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpenumaction.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppluginaction.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpstringaction.[ch]: added parameters to the
	gimp_*_action_selected() function so the "selected" signal can be
	emitted with value != action->value. Changed GtkAction::activate()
	implementations accordingly (pass action->value).

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: call gimp_enum_action_selected()
	and pass the value of the GimpControllerEventValue instead of
	temporarily replacing action->value and calling
	gtk_action_activate().

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c: fixed debugging output.

2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.[ch]: added signal "set-brush" which is
	G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST so we can connect before and after the default
	implementation. Moved the brush setting and outline invalidation
	stuff to its default implementation. Also remember the outline's
	width and height. Call gimp_brush_core_set_brush() from
	gimp_brush_core_invalidate_cache() so "set-brush" is emitted
	whenever a generated brush becomes dirty.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c (gimp_paint_tool_button_press): don't
	pause/resume but rather stop/start the draw_tool. Fixes straight
	line preview aretefacts.

	(gimp_paint_tool_oper_update): set the brush_core's brush before
	starting the draw_tool.

	(gimp_paint_tool_draw): never free the brush_core's cached brush
	outline because the brush_core does that by itself now.

	(gimp_paint_tool_set_brush)
	(gimp_paint_tool_set_brush_after): new callbacks which pause and
	resume the draw_tool. Fixes brush outline artefacts when modifying
	the current brush e.g. by using the mouse wheel.

2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-commands.h: removed enum GimpContextSelectType.

	* app/actions/actions-types.h: added enum GimpActionSelectType.

	* app/actions/actions.[ch]: added utility functions
	action_select_value() and action_select_object().

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]: merged the layer select
	callbacks into one using the GimpActionSelectType functions. Added
	actions and callbacks for modifying the active layer's opacity.

	* app/menus/menus-types.h: #incude "actions/action-types.h".

	* app/gui/gui-types.h: #incude "menus/menus-types.h".

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: allow to enable/disable input
	controllers.

2004-06-22  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

2004-06-22  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts: HIG-ified capitalization on
	all.  Finishes this for everything in plug-ins.  Bug #123699 is
	now mostly fixed.
	
2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-regression.c: define timersub()
	macro in case it's undefined. Patch by Tim Mooney, fixes 'make
	check' on Tru64 (bug #144780).

2004-06-22  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c: added Store/Recall buttons for
	one-click saving and loading of curves.  Should create stock
	labels for them.  Hopefully resolves bug #75558.
	
2004-06-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: added actions & callbacks to
	configure the canvas padding color.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h
	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added the actions' help IDs and menu entries.

	* app/display/display-enums.h: added /*< skip >*/'ed enum value
	GIMP_CANVAS_PADDING_MODE_RESET.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: removed the canvas padding
	button and its popup menu (fixes bug #142996). Instead, added a
	toggle button which allows to zoom the image when the window is
	resized (as known from sodipodi, except it doesn't work as nice
	yet :-) improvements to the algorithm are welcome).
	Cleaned up the GimpDisplayShell struct a bit and renamed some
	of its members.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpstock.[ch]
	* themes/Default/images/Makefile.am
	* themes/Default/images/stock-zoom-follow-window-12.png: added new
	icon for the new display toggle button.

2004-06-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c (gimp_clone_tool_draw): chain up
	unconditionally now that we draw the brush outline while
	painting. Fixes brush outline artefacts on button_press and
	button_release. Spotted by sjburges.

2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_set_image): unset
	the filename if the image is unnamed.

	* configure.in
	* app/sanity.c: depend on gtk+ >= 2.4.1.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.[ch]: changed gimp_thumb_box_set_uris()
	to gimp_thumb_box_take_uris() since the function takes ownership
	of the list,
	
	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c: changed accordingly. Removed code
	that worked around a problem in gtk+ < 2.4.1.

2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorarea.c (gimp_color_area_set_color): use
	gimp_rgb_distance() for flat color areas. Fixes bug #144786.

2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c is a
	generated file, need to do the documentation change here.

	* app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpfileops_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c: use radio buttons
	for constraint options.  Makes all options visible,
	should resolve bug #68106.
	
2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c: to reduce clutter, hide overwrite
	query dialog after user has responded.
	
2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c: changed handling of alpha
	channel in an attempt to deal with bug #72853.
	Changed menu entry from "Noisify" to "Scatter RGB".
	
2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c: fixed incorrect documentation for
	gimp_file_load, which was the root cause of bug #118811.
	
2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins: finish implementing HIG capitalization in dialogs.
	Scripts remain to be done.  More progress on bug #123699.

2004-06-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch] (enum GimpCursorFormat): removed
	value GIMP_CURSOR_FORMAT_PIXBUF_PREMULTIPLY because it's the job
	of GDK to do that (it was GDK that was broken, not some of the X
	servers).

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c (gimp_cursor_new): premultiply the
	cursor's pixels for GTK+ < 2.4.4.

2004-06-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_exit_callback): improved message in quit
	dialog just in case that we don't manage to redo this dialog
	before 2.2.

2004-06-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added new utility function
	gimp_label_set_attributes().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/gui/resolution-calibrate-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpviewabledialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c: use the new function.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: display the name in italic.

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: display the file size in italic.

2004-06-20  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/url.c: if url does not end in a recognized
	extension, open it as an unnamed image.  Fixes bug #118811.

2004-06-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrambox.[ch]: removed the label between the
	spinbuttons, it looks silly. Converted tabs to spaces, removed
	trailing whitespace.

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c
	* app/tools/gimpthresholdtool.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins:  changed dialogs to follow HIG capitalization style 
	wherever they didn't.  Scripts remain to be done.  Partially
	fixes bug #123699.

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrambox.[ch]:
	* app/tools/gimpthresholdtool.c: Changed the threshold tool dialog 
	so that it uses a two-triangle-slider scale of the sort used in the 
	levels tool.  Almost all of the changes are actually in the 
	histogram-box widget code, which is only used by the threshold 
	tool.  Fixes bug #137521.

2004-06-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: removed redundant hboxes and other
	layout cleanups.

2004-06-20  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.[ch]:
	* app/display/gimpnavigationview.[ch]:
	* app/actions/view-actions.c:
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]:
	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h:
	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: Changed "Zoom to Fit Window" command
	to "Fit Image in Window" and added another command, "Fit Image

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added missing 
	gimp_controller_* entries

2004-06-19  Michael Schumacher  <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: more changes to save dialog.  Moved
	comment field to Advanced area.  Don't set restart marker
	frequency stuff insensitive.  Changed range for quality
	scale from 0-1 to 0-100 to follow the jpeg spec (but left
	allowable range for pdb at 0-1 to avoid breaking anything).

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c: fixed my fix for bug # 68106, which 
	worked incorrectly for two of the control points.

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_midi.c (midi_read_event): simplified
	swallowing of SysEx messages and unwanted data bytes. Reordered
	and commented stuff to be more readable.

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/Makefile.am
	* modules/controller_midi.c: new controller for MIDI input. Maps
	all note on and note off events and all MIDI controllers to
	GimpContollerEvents. Should parse any MIDI stream. Code based on
	blinkenmedia stuff from Daniel Mack.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Applied a patch from Geert Jordaens that implements the
	GtkStatusbar functionality in GimpStatusbar so that we can redo it
	in order to fix bug #120175:

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list: added VOID: UINT, STRING.

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.[ch]: copied GtkStatusbar code.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose_utils.c (create_brush): use
	G_SQRT2; some coding style cleanups.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c (arcto_ellipsesegment): moved
	array initialization out of variable declaration (bug #144632).

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c (arcto_ellipsesegment): use
	G_SQRT2 to make circlemagic a constant value so we can initialize
	the array on declaration. Fixes bug #144632.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* devel-docs/parasites.txt: document "exif-data" parasite.

2004-06-18  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/film.c: Don't use deprecated gimp_text functions,
	clean up font name string handling a bit, default is now "Monospace"
	instead of "Courier".

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c (gimp_controllers_event_mapped):
	start supporting GIMP_CONTROLLER_EVENT_VALUE of type gdouble.
	Assume the double value is in a [0.0..1.0] range and temporarily
	change the value of the called GimpEnumAction to a range of
	[0..1000] when invoking it. All still very hackish...

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c (gimp_controller_info_event):
	more debugging output.

2004-06-18 Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c: changed algorithm for scaling when
	aspect ratio is constrained, to fix strange behavior described 
	in bug # 68106.

2004-06-18 Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c:  redid save dialog along lines suggested
	in bug # 138929

	Only create an exif data parasite on loading file if the file actually 
	contains exif data.

	Call exif data parasite "exif-data" instead of "jpeg-exif-data",
	because it should be interchangeable with TIFF exif data.
	
2004-06-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]: added tons of new actions to
	modify the current FG/BG color's RGB components.

	Added new enum value GIMP_CONTEXT_SELECT_SET which allows to set
	values, not only increase/decrease them.

	Changed context_select_value() utility function to interpret
	GimpEnumAction::value being >= GIMP_CONTEXT_SELECT_SET as settings
	in a range from 0 to 1000. Yes, that's a hack...

2004-06-18  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: reverted my fix to bug #144570.

2004-06-18  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimpfuzzyselecttool.c: Fix fuzzy select menu label.

2004-06-18  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c (gimp_transform_tool_bounds):
	If transforming a path, use the path bounds rather than the mask
	bounds. Fixes bug #144570.

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-utils.[ch]: added gimp_boolean_handled_accum().

	* app/core/gimp.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c: use it.

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpcontainer.c (gimp_container_deserialize): add newly
	created children to the container *after* deserializing them so
	GimpContainer::add() callbacks get the already deserialized
	object.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: connect to "add" and "remove" of
	the controller list and remember / clear the wheel controller when
	it appears / disappears.

2004-06-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: check for xsltproc and mention that the intltool
	version mismatch is harmless.

2004-06-17  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: Fix typos and improve documentation.
	Addresses bug #144267.

	* app/pdb/paths_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimppaths_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: removed "enabled"
	property. Removed GIMP_CONTROLLER_PARAM_SERIALIZE from the "name"
	property because it's the hardware-determined name of this
	controller instance.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c
	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: set the name.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h: #include gimpcontroller.h.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: added "enabled" here
	instead.  Don't dispatch events if the controller is
	disabled. Made everything work (not crash) with info->mapping
	being NULL.

	* etc/controllerrc: updated again with the changed format.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.[ch]: added
	gimp_controllers_get_list() which returns the container of
	controllers.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: added controller configuration
	(can't change anything yet, just view the current settings).
	Resurrected the "Input Devices" page and removed the "Session"
	page by moving its widgets to other pages. Pack the various
	"Save now"/"Clear now" buttons vertically, not horizontally.
	Fixes bug #139069.

	* themes/Default/images/preferences/Makefile.am
	* themes/Default/images/preferences/controllers.png
	* themes/Default/images/preferences/theme.png: new icons for new
	prefs pages. Someone needs to make them nice...

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c: GtkUIManager makes the menu bar
	visible by default, hide it if options->show_menubar is FALSE.
	Fixes bug #143243.

2004-06-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.1.1. Allow to disable the
	build of the linux_input controller module.

2004-06-17  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): Make transforms (most
	notably perspective transforms) conform exactly to specified
	edges. Includes a patch by David Gowers. Fixes bug #144352.

2004-06-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: put BTN_{WHEEL,GEAR_DOWN,GEAR_UP}
	usage in #ifdefs, since pre-2.6 kernels do not have them.

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c (linux_input_read_event): n_bytes
	should be a gsize.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]: added actions & callback
	to select the first/last/prev/next tool.

2004-06-16  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: removed BTN_MISC, 
	since it is the same as BTN_0 in the input.h header file.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.c (gimp_controller_get_event_name)
	(gimp_controller_get_event_blurb): always return a non-NULL
	string (return "<invalid event id>" as fallback).

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: reenabled button event
	dispatching.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c: fixed debugging output.

2004-06-16  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: break out of the
	loop after we handled the first matching rel_event.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: added #define
	GIMP_CONTROLLER_PARAM_SERIALIZE. Made all properties serializable.

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: made "device-name"
	serializable.

	* app/config/gimpconfig-params.h: added macro
	GIMP_CONFIG_INSTALL_PROP_POINTER() which needs to be handled
	by custom (de)serialize_property() implementations.

	* app/config/gimpconfig-deserialize.c
	* app/config/gimpconfig-serialize.c: made object (de)serialization
	work for object properties which are *not* GIMP_PARAM_AGGREGATE.
	Write/parse the exact type of the object to create to enable this.

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list: new marshaller for GimpControllerInfo.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: implement GimpConfigInterface
	and add "controller" and "mapping" properties. Add "event-mapped"
	signal which carries the action_name.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: removed all deserialization code
	and simply (de)serialize the controller container. Install a
	container handler for "event-mapped" and do the action_name ->
	action mapping in the callback.

	* etc/controllerrc: regenerated with new syntax. Delete your old one!

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c
	(gimp_controller_wheel_get_event_name): don't use gettext() here.

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: added more button events, set
	the device name, some cleanup.

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: changed dependencies for blur.

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/common/blur.c: no need to include libgimpui.h any longer.

2004-06-16  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/blur.c: removed randomize and repeat options;
	made to run without popping a dialog.  (bug #142318)

2004-06-16  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: enable dial-events for
	e.g. the powermate. Fixed typo.

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added missing menu entries (bug #144449).

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: added
	GimpController::get_event_blurb() which returns the strings that
	were returned by get_event_name(). The latter returns
	untranslatable event identifiers now.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c
	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: changed the event mapping from
	event-id -> action-name to event-name -> action-name.

	* etc/controllerrc: changed accordingly (finally readable now).

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: made an object out of
	the GimpControllerInfo struct.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-16  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* etc/controllerrc: fix typo

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c
	* etc/controllerrc: preliminary wheel event support.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: better debugging output.

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: bug fix.

	* configure.in: check for linux/input.h.

	* modules/Makefile.am
	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: added a prototype controller
	module using the linux input event interface.

	* etc/controllerrc: added example config for linux input device.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: load the controller's
	properties from the controllerrc file.

	* etc/controllerrc: set the wheel's properties.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* etc/controllerrc: use the 10% actions for opacity.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: ref the actions when putting
	them in the mapping table.

	* app/actions/context-actions.c: added actions to change the
	opacity in 10% steps.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: added a "name" property.
	Dispatch events only if the controller is enabled.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c: added controller events for
	all possible modifier combinations.

	* etc/Makefile.am
	* etc/controllerrc: default controllerrc which maps all unused
	wheel+modifier combinations to more-or-less usefull stuff.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Started to fix bug #106920 in a more genreral way:

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetsmarshal.list
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: new abstract base class
	which provides an API for pluggable input controller modules
	(mouse wheel, usb/midi stuff etc.).

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.[ch]: subclass of the above
	which maps wheel mouse scroll events to controller events.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.[ch]: manager for controllers.
	reads $(gimpdir)/controllerrc and keeps a mapping of controller
	events to GtkActions.

	* app/gui/gui.c: initialize and shut down the controller stuff.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): if a wheel controller
	exists, dispatch GdkEventScroll to it first and return if it was
	handled.

2004-06-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: deprecate the XLFD-based API
	gimp_text() and gimp_text_get_extents().

	* app/pdb/text_tool_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimptexttool_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-06-15  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdbgen.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl: some simplistic code to add a $deprecated
	flag to pdb definitions, which translates into GIMP_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
	guards in lib headers.

2004-06-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/context-actions.[ch]
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]: added new action group to
	modify all GimpContext properties. So far there are actions to
	cycle through the lists of brushes, patterns etc., to change the
	opacity, to swap and default colors and to edit generated brushes.

	* app/actions/actions.c: register the new "context" action group.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c
	* app/actions/tools-commands.[ch]: removed "tools-default-colors"
	and "tools-swap-colors" actions and callbacks because they are
	in the "context" action group now.

	* app/menus/menus.c: add the "context" group to the <Image> and
	<Dock> UI managers.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: changed accordingly. Added a temporary
	"Context" menu to test and debug the new actions.

2004-06-15  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c (crop_selection_callback): Force
	aspect ratio to match selection when 'From Selection' is clicked.
	Fixes bug #144361. Also converted tabs to spaces.

2004-06-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mng.c (respin_cmap): applied the fix for empty
	colormaps (bug #143009) here as well.

2004-06-15  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): Don't round texture
	coordinates when not using interpolation. Fixes bug #144352 for
	the nearest neighbor case only.

2004-06-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpinkoptions.c: replaced some arbitrary values with
	larger but still arbitrary values (default and limit for ink size).

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: removed PRETRACE_PAINT and
	POSTTRACE_PAINT from the GimpPaintCoreState enum. Removed
	"gboolean traces_on_window" from GimpPaintCoreClass.

	* app/paint/gimpclone.[ch]
	* app/paint/gimpink.c
	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c: ditto. Show the brush outline
	while painting. Fixes bug #118348.

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: use gimp_draw_tool_is_active()
	instead of GIMP_IS_DISPLAY(draw_tool->gdisp).

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c (gimp_action_group_add_*_actions):
	do the workaround for "" accelerators only if the GTK+ version
	is smaller than 2.4.3. Fixes bug #144342 for GTK+ >= 2.4.3.

2004-06-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c: declared
	gimp_drawable_transform_cubic() as inline function. Makes
	sample_cubic() run about 10% faster and causes a 7% speedup on
	cubic transformations.

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.c (border_region): avoid an
	unnecessary memory allocation.

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: Disable preview in corrective
	mode, and notify preview when switching transform type and
	direction.

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: added new virtual function
	GimpPaintCore::post_paint() and call it after calling
	GimpPaintCore::paint().

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.[ch]: renamed brush_core->grr_brush
	to brush_core->main_brush and reset brush_core->brush
	to brush_core->main_brush in GimpPaintCore::post_paint().

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c
	* app/paint/gimppaintcore-stroke.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c: removed all code which restores
	the brush_core's old brush after painting since post_paint()
	does this automatically now.

	* app/paint/gimpclone.[ch]: moved static variables to the
	GimpClone struct.

2004-06-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-generic.h (color_pixels): some code
	cleanup I did while attempting to optimize this code further.

2004-06-14  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c: let extensions run synchronously when
	called via PDB. Fixes bug #140112.

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: Preview is now only used for
	layer transformations.

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.c
	* app/tools/gimprotatetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c
	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.c: removed calls to
	gimp_transform_tool_expose_preview() from all
	GimpTransformTool::motion() implementations...

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: ...and call it after calling
	tr_tool_class->preview().

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: remember the last used
	GimpCursorFormat so changing the format in prefs applies
	instantly, and not after the next tool change.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimptoolcontrol.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcolortool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c
	* app/tools/gimpmeasuretool.c
	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: s/GdkCursorType/GimpCursorType/g

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c (gimp_transform_tool_doit): Preview
	wasn't being turned off before performing a transformation. Also
	converted tabs to spaces.

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: Transformation previews now
	use the selection mask if it is present.

2004-06-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: Make sure PangoFT2 is using a recent enough fontconfig
	since many people have broken and confused setups.

2004-06-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_edit.pdb: cleans ups so generated
	output doesn't warn about uninitialize variable use, and whitespace
	cosmetic cleanups.

	* app/pdb/gradient_edit_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-06-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/base/cpu-accel.c: Reorged, to address bug #142907 and
	bug #143069. Accel implementations #define HAVE_ACCEL, and cpu_accel()
	keys on that. Both PPC and X86 implementations check for __GNUC__.
	X86 stuff is only used with USE_MMX is defined. The SSE OS check
	is now checked in arch_accel(), not cpu_accel(). Finally, the
	arch x86_64 checks now are EM64T aware (which didn't matter in
	practice).

2004-06-13  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: use drawable_mask_bounds()
	for texture coordinates instead of the drawable's width and height.

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.c (shapeburst_region): don't call
	tile_ewidth() three times from the inner loop.

	* app/base/tile-manager.c (tile_manager_get): don't call
	tile_size() twice on the same tile.

	* app/base/tile-private.h: added tile_size_inline(), an inline
	version of the tile_size() function.

	* app/base/tile-cache.c
	* app/base/tile-manager.c
	* app/base/tile-swap.c
	* app/base/tile.c: use tile_size_inline() from inside the tile
	subsystem.

2004-06-13  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c: Minor tweaks to two macros.
	Shouldn't change anything.

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/tool-zoom.png:
	* cursors/cursor-zoom.png: minor fsckup

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf
	* cursors/tool-burn.png: the burn tool doesn't really have an
	  inverted handle

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.[ch] (shapeburst_region): added
	progress callback.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c: show a progress while calculating
	the Shapeburst. Not perfect but better than not showing any
	progress at all.

2004-06-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch]: added enum GimpCursorFormat
	which can be one of { BITMAP, PIXBUF, PIXBUF-PREMULTIPLY } to
	work around broken X servers.

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.[ch]
	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h: added GimpGuiConfig::cursor-format.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: added a GUI for the new option.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.[ch]: added cursor_format parameter
	to gimp_cursor_new() and _set().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.c
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.c: pass an appropriate cursor_mode.

2004-06-12  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c: added missing semicolon.

2004-06-12  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: Fixed incorrect logic that
	caused perfect-but-slow pointer tracking to be used in tools that
	don't request exact mode.

	* app/display/Makefile.am:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.[ch]:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.[ch]: added
	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.c:
	* app/tools/gimprotatetool.c:
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c:
	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.c:
	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.[ch]:
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: Implemented live transformation
	previews, available through tool options. Fixes bug #108172.

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c (gradient_render_pixel): inline
	the repeat functions.

	* app/core/gimpgradient.c: inline the curve functions.

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf
	* cursors/tool-zoom.png: make more transparent

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf
	* cursors/tool-blur.png
	* cursors/tool-bucket-fill.png
	* cursors/tool-dodge.png
	* cursors/tool-eraser.png
	* cursors/tool-hand.png: fix a few problems hidden by low opacity

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursor/*png: updated the cursors

2004-06-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf: added nice new antialiased
	cursor layers made by Jimmac.

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppalette.c (gimp_palette_load): don't use the rather
	inefficient gimp_palette_add_entry() when loading a palette.

2004-06-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdata.[ch]: added "gint freeze_count" and
	gimp_data_freeze()/thaw() functions. Emit "dirty" only if
	freeze_count either is 0 or drops to 0.

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpgradient.[ch]: removed freeze/thaw stuff that
	was duplicated in these two subclasses and use the new
	GimpData API instead.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolorbar.c (gimp_color_bar_expose): don't copy
	the first row onto itself.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: Make Enter/Return apply the
	transformation, Backspace/Delete resets the transformation.

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: Simplify the key_press callback.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: Make the Enter/Return key do
	the crop action.

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: Make the _key_press functions
	safe for non-arrow keys.

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite.[ch]: just some cleanup.

2004-06-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_events): ported some forgotten #if 0'ed
	GtkItemFactory stuff to GtkUIManager.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]: renamed the "arrow_key" member
	to "key_press", since it is now no longer about just the arrow
	keys.

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.h
	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c
	* app/tools/gimpselectiontool.c
	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c
	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: Changed accordingly.

2004-06-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_init): add
	the file DND destination before all others so the DND code will
	implicitly use its destination properties. Works around Konqueror
	offering only file MOVE, not COPY and fixes bug #144168.

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sample_colorize.c: reindented, some minor cleanup.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]: renamed
	tool_manager_arrow_key_active to tool_manager_key_press_active.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: Also dispatch
	GDK_Return/KP_Enter/BackSpace/Delete to the tools, the
	"arrow_key" member of GimpTool probably should be renamed.

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: Use Enter/Return to convert the
	current path to a selection, use Backspace/Delete to delete the
	currently active anchors in a path.

	Implemented on Jimmacs request - thanks to him and Iva for being
	a great host  :)

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c (gimp_histogram_editor_init):
	set the initially selected channel on the histogram combobox.
	Fixes bug #144225.

2004-06-12  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.[ch]: renamed all "pressure-pressure"
	variables to "pressure-hardness".

	* app/paint/gimpairbrush.c:
	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorarea.c: replaced destroy() by
	finalize(), converted tabs to spaces, cleanup.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c (gimp_thumb_box_new): line-wrap the
	filename label if it's too long instead of cutting it off.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h (enum GimpCursorModifier):
	s/GIMP_LAST_CURSOR_MODIFIER_ENTRY/GIMP_CURSOR_MODIFIER_LAST/.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c: changed accordingly. Renamed struct
	GimpBitmapCursor to GimpCursor. More cleanup.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/image-actions.c
	* app/actions/image-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]: made the
	"image-convert-rgb/grayscale/indexed" and the
	"layers-mask-apply/delete" actions GimpEnumActions and merged
	their callbacks.

2004-06-10  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: restored the 'Show Paint Tool
	Cursor' option that was removed during clean-up.

2004-06-10  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_pressurize_mask):
	avoided some redundant calculations.

2004-06-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/user-install-dialog.c: removed the monitor calibration
	from the user installation process. It's not a vital setting and
	can be done from the Preferences dialog later.

	* app/gui/resolution-calibrate-dialog.[ch]: simplified the
	resolution calibration dialog by removing the hacks that were
	needed for drawing it in the user-installation style.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: changed accordingly. Also removed
	the separator from the Display page.

2004-06-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.[ch]: added an API to
	expand/collapse the "Advanced Options" frame.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: applied a patch done by William
	Skaggs that cleans up and reorganizes the Preferences dialog
	(bug #144060).

2004-06-09  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpcoords.[ch]: renamed gimp_coords_length2 to
	gimp_coords_length_squared.

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c: Changed accordingly

2004-06-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimppenciltool.c (gimp_pencil_tool_init): no need to
	request GIMP_MOTION_MODE_EXACT here since the parent class does
	that already.

	* app/tools/gimpinktool.c (gimp_ink_tool_init): ditto. Enable the
	color picker feature for the ink tool.

2004-06-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added "Selection Editor" to the
	Selection menu. Still hoping for the great menu reorganization
	though...

	* app/actions/select-actions.c (select_actions_update): "Save to
	Channel" makes sense without a selection also, so don't set it
	insensitive.

2004-06-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/glob.c: the glob(3) function is not available on
	Win32 and also isn't necessarily UTF-8 safe. Started to add an
	alternative implementation. Right now there's just some code taken
	from GTK+ (an UTF-8 save fnmatch() implementation) and the plug-in
	does nothing useful. I will add some stripped-down glob code based
	on the code in glibc later.

2004-06-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_set_tiles): don't set
	layer->mask's offsets. It is wrong because GimpDrawable::set_tiles()
	is a lowlevel function which is used by stuff like scale and
	resize which keep the mask in sync explicitely and don't expect it
	to be moved in the middle of chaining up. Fixes bug #143860.

2004-06-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: added separate callback for
	"view-zoom-other" and connect GtkAction::activate manually so
	"Other..." can be selected even if it's the active item in the
	zoom radio group. Fixes bug #143850.

2004-06-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tileit.c (tileit_dialog): fixed a typo.

2004-06-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c (plug_in_menus_setup): sort the menus
	by the translated menu path stripped from underscores.

2004-06-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c (gauss): fixed a stupid cut'n'paste bug
	I introduced yesterday.

2004-06-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c (query): register the menu entry the new
	way and install a mnemonic for Gaussian Blur.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/curve_bend.c: applied a patch from Henrik Brix
	Andersen that tells the user that Curve Bend cannot operate on
	layers with masks instead of silently applying the mask
	(bug #134748).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/gauss_iir.c
	* plug-ins/common/gauss_rle.c: removed the two gaussian blur
	plug-ins...

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c: and added a merged version done by
	William Skaggs. Fixes bug #134088.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sgi/sgi.c: applied a patch from Philip Lafleur that
	makes the plug-in handle images with more than 4 channels. At the
	moment the extra information is discarded (bug #143673).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: applied a modified patch from Geert
	Jordaens that adds a preview to the Unsharp Mask plug-in. Fixes
	bug #140974.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.c
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-generic.h
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.[ch]: applied a patch from Philip
	Lafleur that changes the way that paint is applied during a paint
	stroke. Fixes bug #124225.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/glob.c: added a simple glob plug-in based on
	some old code by George Hartz. This plug-in is very useful when
	you need to do batch processing, especially from Script-Fu.
	Fixes bug #143661.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c: applied a patch from David
	Gowers that makes the gradient editor display the perceptual
	intensity of the color under the cursor (bug #135037).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/snoise.c: applied a modifed patch from Yeti that
	adds a preview to the Solid Noise plug-in (bug #142587).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c: save the proper value for type of alpha
	channel. Fixes bug #143522; patch by Philip Lafleur.

2004-06-05  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_dialog_new): update call
	to prefs_spin_button_add for num-processors too.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c (script_fu_interface):
	left align toggle buttons.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimptextlayer-transform.[ch]: updated the (still unused)
	text transformation code.

	* app/text/gimptext-bitmap.c: removed a redundant transformation.

2004-06-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/Makefile.am
	* cursors/cursor-none.png
	* cursors/xbm/cursor-none.xbm: new empty cursor images.

	* app/config/gimpdisplayconfig.[ch]
	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h
	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpinktool.c
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: applied patches from Philip
	Lafleur which implement hiding the cursor completely for paint
	tools. Changed the name of the config option from
	"hide-paint-tool-cursor" to "show-paint-tool-cursor" and default
	to TRUE because this needs the brush outline being visible while
	painting to be really usable. Fixes bug #132163.

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h: renamed all GimpCursorType and
	GimpToolCursorType enum values to GIMP_CURSOR_* and
	GIMP_TOOL_CURSOR_*.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.c
	* app/tools/gimp*tool.c; changed accordingly.

2004-06-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c: changed create_cursor_foo() utility
	functions to get_cursor_foo() and use them as accessors instead of
	using cursor->member. Use gdk_pixbuf_copy() instead of compositing
	the initial image onto an empty pixbuf.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptexteditor.c (gimp_text_editor_new): set the
	focus on the text area.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_class_init): allow to
	move a text layer using the cursor keys.

2004-06-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/*.xbm: removed...

	* cursors/xbm/*.xbm: ...and added here instead. Renamed them
	all to match the PNG file names.

	* cursors/Makefile.am: changed accordingly.

	* app/widget/gimpcursor.c: ditto. Merged the two cursor creating
	functions again because they duplicated too much code.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c (plug_in_menus_setup): populate the
	tree with collation keys and use strcmp() instead of
	g_utf8_collate() as the tree's sort function.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.c (DEFAULT_PRESSURE_PRESSURE):
	applied a patch by Philip Lafleur that changes the default to
	FALSE. Fixes bug #143626.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimpmp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c (gimp_toolbox_size_allocate): use
	gtk_widget_size_request() instead of _get_child_requisition()
	because we need to know the size of the toolbox' areas
	even if they are invisible. Fixes SIGFPE spotted by Jimmac.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c: some cleanup. Make the tool_cursor
	and cursor_modifier components slightly transparent.

	* cursors/cursor-mouse.png: was the wrong image.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/Makefile.am
	* cursors/*.png: added PNG version of all cursors.

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf: reordered and renamed all layers
	to match the new PNG filenames.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.[ch]: create cursors with alpha and color
	if the GdkDisplay supports it. Fall back to the old stuff
	otherwise.

2004-06-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppattern.c (gimp_pattern_load_pixbuf): if a Title is
	set, use that as the pattern name.

2004-06-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c (gimp_data_factory_load_data):
	removed commented-out message.

	* app/core/gimppattern.[ch]: fixed handling of errors and PNG
	comments in new pattern loader. Renamed functions for consistency
	with other data loaders.

	* app/core/gimp.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-03  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp.c:
	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c:
	* app/core/gimppattern.[ch]: Add support for GdkPixbuf patterns, 
	so now all of png, jpex, pnm, xbm, bmp, gif, ico, pcx, ras, tga, 
	xpm and tiff can be used for patterns.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c: added alternative actions
	"vectors-selection-from-vectors" and
	"vectors-selection-to-vectors-short" with different labels suited
	for the "Select" menu.

	* app/actions/select-actions.c: removed "select-from-vectors"
	and "select-to-vectors" (to vectors was crashing anyway).

	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]: removed
	select_from_vectors_cmd_callback(). Fixes code dupliction.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* menus/selection-editor-menu.xml: changed accordingly.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c (control_motion): use the newly
	added GimpGradient API to set the segment's handles instead of
	setting the values directly. Dirties the gradient correctly and
	makes the preview update instantly again. Fixes bug #143605.

2004-06-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/file-open-location-dialog.c
	(file_open_location_completion): check for NULL pointer before
	passing it to g_utf8_normalize(). Just a workaround for a problem
	in GimpContainerView.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: more updates.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_edit.pdb: set_blending_function() and
	set_coloring_type() work on segment ranges, renamed them
	accordingly. Spotted by Shlomi Fish.

	* app/pdb/gradient_edit_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpgradientedit_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	instead.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.c (gimp_display_shell_drop_files):
	show the error message if opening a dropped file fails.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c: plugged a small memory leak.

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.h: removed enum GimpDndType...

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h: ...and added it here.

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c: added more g_return_if_fail(). Allow
	all gimp_dnd_foo_dest_add() functions to be called without
	callback (just add the target if callback is NULL).

	(gimp_dnd_open_files): removed the checks for validity of the
	passed filenames/uris...

	(gimp_dnd_set_file_data): ...and added it here so all callbacks
	get an already sanitized list of strings.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST)
	* app/menus/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): removed makefile.msc until
	they have been added.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerview.c: create the hash table when
	inserting items; removes redundant create/destroy cycles and plugs
	a memory leak.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: updated for gimp-2.1. Suggest to use gimp-print
	version 4.2.7-pre1 in case of problems (see bug #138273).

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.c
	(gimp_display_shell_drop_files): copy the merged layer, not the
	first one. Preserve the type of the layer to make e.g. dropping an
	XCF with a single text layer work.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS
	* README: updated.

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_init): accept
	file/uri drops.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.[ch]
	(gimp_display_shell_drop_files): open any kind of image and turn
	it into a single layer which is added to the image (suggested by
	Antenne Springborn).

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_edit.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradients.pdb: mark new API as new using $since.

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: reverted changes I did to the image
	unit earlier. As in 2.0, it will continue to not accept pixels.
	This makes the PDB API and the XCF format compatible again and
	fixes bug #142961 (and to some extent bug #137704).
 
	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/gimpimage-unit.[ch]: removed these files. The
	convenience accessors defined here aren't commonly used any
	longer.

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: added a unit parameter to
	gimp_display_new(). Made "unit" and "scale" properties of

	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.c (gimp_session_info_restore): added
	a horrible hack that sets the paned's position after the first
	"size-allocate" after "map". Makes position remembering work for
	the toolbox and fixes bug #142697.

	gimp_dockable_set_tab_style()

	* app/actions/dockable-commands.c (dockable_tab_style_cmd_callback)
	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.c (gimp_session_info_restore):

	Fixes bug #129675 and bug #129678.

	Did some cleanups / enhancments to the patch:

	* app/core/gimpgradient.[ch]: changed the naming scheme of the new
	functions and changed old functions to match the new scheme.
	Introduce a "freeze_count" and public freeze()/thaw() API which
	enables subsequent gradient changes without "dirty" being emitted
	all the time.  Added GimpGradient parameters to all functions

	URI instead of forwarding it unmodified.

2004-05-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppreview.c (gimp_preview_button_press_event):

2004-05-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimpfont.c (gimp_font_get_popup_size)

	it with NULL. Fixes bug #143258.

2004-05-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpink.c: restored old time/speed sensitivity
	behaviour by doing nothing except figuring if we draw a straight

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch] (gimp_paint_core_paste)

	parameters by "PixelRegion *mask_bufPR", so subclasses can pass in
	any kind of paint_mask buffer and are not restricted to MaskBufs.

	Also removes implicit knowledge about the MaskBuf originating from
	a brush in paint_mask_to_canvas_buf() and _to_canvas_tiles() which
	don't need to offset the mask by width/2 height/2 any more.

	Made gimp_paint_core_validate_undo_tiles() and
	gimp_paint_core_validate_canvas_tiles() protected functions.

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_paste_canvas)

2004-05-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimptoolinfo.[ch]: derive GimpToolInfo from

2004-05-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Long overdue core container cleanup:

	* app/core/gimplist.[ch]: added "unique-names" and "sort-func"
	properties and merged the resp. code from GimpDataList into
	GimpList. Removed "policy" parameters from gimp_list_new() and
	added "unique_names". Added new constructor gimp_list_new_weak().
	Made public function gimp_list_uniquefy_name() private.

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/core-types.h
	* app/core/gimpdatalist.[ch]: removed. Its functionality is
	entirely in GimpList now.

	* app/core/gimpdata.[ch]: added gimp_data_name_compare() which
	used to live in GimpDataList.

	* app/core/gimp.c
	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c
	* app/core/gimpimage.c
	* app/core/gimptoolinfo.c

	* app/widgets/gimpdevices.c
	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.c: changed list creation accordingly.

	Made gimp->templates, gimp->named_buffers, tool_info->presets and
	the image's lists of layers, channels and vectors automatically
	ensure unique names.

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateview.c
	* app/actions/file-commands.c
	* app/actions/templates-commands.c
	* app/actions/tool-options-commands.c: removed calls to
	gimp_list_uniquefy_name().

	* app/core/gimpitem.c: removed major insanity where the items
	themselves where ensuring their unique names. Bah!

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_name_changed): chain up
	conditionally.

	* app/core/gimplayermask.c (gimp_layer_mask_name_changed): removed
	because there is no need any more to keep the parent
	implementation from being invoked.

2004-05-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	#142996

2004-05-23  Žygimantas Beručka  <uid0@akl.lt>

	* configure.in: Added "lt" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-05-23  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def: gimp_register_file_handler_mime added

2004-05-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: reoedered to somehow reflect the
	class hierarchy.

	Some dockable context handling cleanup:

	* app/widgets/gimpdocked.[ch]: removed "prev_context" parameter
	from GimpDocked::set_context(). Widgets which need the old context
	to disconnect from should remember it themselves.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c (gimp_dockable_set_context): don't
	pass the old context to gimp_docked_set_context().
	Some cleanup.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/display/gimpnavigationview.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpimageeditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.[ch]: added a "context" member
	which holds the context set by GimpDocked::set_context().

	* app/widgets/gimpdrawabletreeview.c: use the view's context
	instead of gimp_get_user_context().

	* app/widgets/gimpcoloreditor.[ch]: removed separate API to
	set the context because it implements the GimpDockedInterface.

	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimperrorconsole.c: pass "menu-factory",
	"menu-identifier" and "ui-path" to g_object_new() instead of
	calling gimp_editor_create_menu() later.

	Action cleanup partly related to the context stuff above:

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_data_get_gimp): get the Gimp from
	context->gimp, not gimage->gimp because gimage may be NULL.

	(action_data_get_context): changed to use the new context members
	added above.

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c (channels_actions_update): cleanup.

	* app/actions/edit-actions.c (edit_actions_update): fixed
	sensitivity of "edit-undo-clear".

	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c (vectors_actions_update): make
	"vectors-merge-visible" sensitive only if there is more than one
	GimpVectors in the image.

	* app/actions/colormap-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/palette-editor-actions.c: added FG/BG color previews
	to actions which take colors from them. Changed code to be safe
	against "context" being NULL.

	* app/actions/drawable-commands.c:
	s/active_drawable/drawable/g. Makes the code more readable.

	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: removed public stroke utility
	functions and other stuff which is not needed any more because
	dialog buttons invoke the correct actions now. Moved the
	functions' code to the resp. action callbacks.

2004-05-21  Nathan Summers  <rock@gimp.org>

	Somehow some of the changes from my commit on 2004-05-18 seem to have
	gotten lost, including the addition to the ChangeLog.  Sorry about that.
	Recommitted.

	* NEWS: Clarified end-user visible features.  
	Made sundry small grammar and consistancy fixes.  
	Reorganized list of changes slightly.

2004-05-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.c (gimp_paint_core_interpolate): better

2004-05-20  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_*.[ch]: (partly) HIG-ified, replaced

	use file choosers instead of file selectors, minor clean-up.

2004-05-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* menus/menus.xsl: put the image popup menu into a dummy menubar

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c

	"notify::tearoff-menus" of GimpGuiConfig and reconfigure the
	global image UI manager accordingly.

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.c: removed GIMP_PARAM_RESTART from the
	"tearoff-menus" property because GtkUIManager can change this on
	the fly.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: added the menubar to the
	GimpDisplayShell struct. Some cleanup in gimp_display_shell_new().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.c
	(gimp_display_shell_set_show_menubar): use shell->menubar instead
	of asking the UI manager.

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: changed gimp_ui_manager_ui_get()
	to transparently load the XML files even if a sub-widget was
	requested. Reordered parameters of gimp_ui_manager_ui_popup().
	Lots of internal cleanups.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c: simplified accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_editor_popup_menu() which takes a GimpMenuPositionFunc and
	updates/shows the editor's menu.

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c

	* app/actions/tool-options-actions.c: added icons to the Save,
	Load, Rename and Delete submenus.

2004-05-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/edit-actions.c (edit_actions_update): don't forget
	to set the sensitivity of "edit-named-copy".

2004-05-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_init): initialize the image
	unit to GIMP_UNIT_PIXEL.

	indicating the picked color. Patch from William Skaggs and
	Søren Wedel Nielsen; fixes bug #142506.

2004-05-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-params.c (plug_in_proc_args_check): changed
	warnings to include the invalid menu path. Added check that makes
	sure menu paths are either "<Prefix>" or "<Prefix>/foo" but *not*
	"<Prefix>foo".

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: added function
	plug_in_actions_check_translation() which validates both the
	original and translated menu paths and spits detailed error
	messages if any of them is broken. Made action creation simpler
	(?) and more robust.

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c: argh, the translated menu path must
	be a sorting criteria *only*. Fixed the whole stuff to always use
	the original menu path because translation is done entirely by
	plug-in-actions.c. Fixes bad crashes for all locales. Added
	boolean return value to plug_in_menus_build_path() and don't try
	to create the menu item in an invalid location if creating the
	submenus failed.

2004-05-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus/file-dialog-menu.c: check if the file procedure
	registered a menu path at all. The menu should probably be created
	from the registered menu path, not from gimp->[load|save]_procs.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.[ch]
	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c: removed broken code that used to sort

	action name (taken from shared-mime-info) and register to the <Load>
	and <Save> menus using gimp_plugin_menu_register().

2004-05-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/pdbgen.pl: added new procedure variable 'since'
	that allows to specify when a new function was added. Use that
	info to generate an appropriate gtk-doc comment.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb: set since = '2.2' for the new
	function gimp_plugin_menu_register().

	* libgimp/gimpplugin_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* menus/tool-options-menu.xml: added "name" attributes to all
	submenus.

	* app/menus/tool-options-menu.c: use the menu names instead of the
	overly long action names.

	column which toggles tool visibility.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c (tools_actions_update): don't use
	action_data_get_context() to update the "tools" action group
	because it may return NULL. Use gimp_get_user_context() instead
	because the active tool is global regardless of the action group's
	context. Fixes accidential tool hiding when closing the last
	display.

2004-05-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c (gimp_thumbnail_save_thumb): oops.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Added GimpViewable infrastructure which enables migrating from
	TempBuf to GdkPixbuf for both providing and getting previews:

	* app/core/gimpviewable.[ch]: added new virtual functions
	GimpViewable::get_pixbuf() and GimpViewable::get_new_pixbuf()
	which are implemented exactly as get_preview() and
	get_new_preview() except that get_new_pixbuf() has a default
	implementation which creates the pixbuf from a TempBuf.

	Renamed public functions _get_preview_pixbuf() and
	_get_new_preview_pixbuf() to _get_pixbuf() and _get_new_pixbuf().

	Added gimp_viewable_get_dummy_pixbuf() and use it from
	gimp_viewable_get_dummy_preview().

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c (gimp_imagefile_save_thumb)
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_update_icon)
	* app/gui/resize-dialog.c (resize_dialog_new): changed accordingly.

	* app/menus/image-menu.c
	* app/menus/toolbox-menu.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/menus/file-dialog-menu.[ch]: added factored out code from the
	file-open and file-save menus as file_dialog_menu_setup().

	* app/menus/file-open-menu.c
	* app/menus/file-save-menu.c: call file_dialog_menu_setup().

2004-05-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/documents-actions.c
	* app/actions/documents-commands.c
	* app/actions/edit-actions.c
	* app/actions/edit-commands.[ch]

	* app/actions/select-actions.c
	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: added tooltips for actions
	which are now used for dialog buttons, added callback
	implementations which formerly lived in various widgets, moved
	some actions around and did some general cleanups.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: s/edit-stroke/select-stroke/

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* menus/selection-editor-menu.xml: new popup menu.

	* app/menus/menus.c: register <SelectionEditor> and <UndoEditor>
	UI managers.

	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.[ch]: added construct properties
	"menu-factory", "menu-identifier", "ui-path" and "popup-data".
	Implement GObject::constructor() and create the UI manager
	if all needed properties were set. Enables creating action
	buttons at widget construction time because they need a
	UI manager.

	(gimp_editor_add_action_button): extended to take a va_list of
	"extended" actions which are invoked if the resp. button emits
	"extended_clicked". Store the actions and their modifier masks in
	a list attached to the button.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerview.c
	(gimp_container_view_item_selected): if the view has container
	*and* context, simply change the context and return.

	(gimp_container_view_context_changed): don't emit "select_item"
	manually but simply call gimp_container_view_select_item().

	(gimp_container_view_viewable_dropped): use
	gimp_container_view_item_selected() instead of changing the
	context directly.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.c
	(gimp_container_editor_select_item): update the UI manager.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c: don't try to fiddle with the
	dialog's menu if it doesn't have a ui_path (happens if the UI
	manager is just a collection of actions for the dialog buttons and
	has no menu registered).

	* app/widgets/gimpimageeditor.c: connect to the image's "flush"
	signal and update the UI manager in the callback.

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: use GimpEditor's construct
	properties to create the UI manager so GimpItemTreeView subclasses
	can have action buttons. Update the UI manager in
	gimp_item_tree_view_select_item().

	* app/widgets/gimpbufferview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainergridview.c

	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpdocumentview.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpselectioneditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.[ch]: use action buttons and removed
	lots of callbacks which went to the resp. action callbacks.

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: removed some now unneeded function
	prototypes.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c: changed (simplified) many dialog
	constructors accordingly.

2004-05-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c (gimp_scale_entry_new_internal)
	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_table_attach_stock):

	preview_border_width". Added macro to get the private struct

	* app/tools/gimpmagnifyoptions.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpmagnifytool.c: applied a patch from William Skaggs
	that changes a misleading option label. Fixes bug #137508.

2004-05-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpdisplayconfig.c (DEFAULT_IMAGE_TITLE_FORMAT):

	instead.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: include a preset for the title
	format string that shows the image size (bug #141720).

2004-05-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

2004-05-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Started making the toolbox configurable.
	Addresses bug #105764. Not finished yet.

	* app/core/gimptoolinfo.[ch]: renamed "in_toolbox" to "visible"
	and made it a GObject property.

	gimp_tools_get_default_order() which returns a GList of tool
	identifiers.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c

	toggle a tool's visibility and to reorder the tools.

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.[ch]: removed member "GtkWidget *trash"

	incomplete because there is no fallback help ID yet when pressing
	F1 over a menu item which has a submenu. Added evil workaround and
	version check for signal brokenness of GtkUIManager in GTK+ 2.4.1.

2004-05-09  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	Merge from stable branch :

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c : support gray images;
	fixes bug #141382

	GimpUnitStore.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: hardcode the appearance of the
	GimpUnitComboBox. It uses a hack that doesn't work in list mode.

2004-05-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-colormap.[ch]: added a const qualifier.

	Changed how the image unit and dot-for-dot mode is handled. Might
	break things and certainly needs more changes (mainly in tools):
	
	* app/core/gimptemplate.c: allow GIMP_UNIT_PIXEL as image unit.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-title.c
	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c: always use the image unit for the
	rulers and to display lengths.

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: redone GimpTemplateEditor
	based on a dialog mockup from Jimmac and Tigert.

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: changed some descriptions used by the
	template editor.

2004-05-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	formatting cleanups in some query() functions.

2004-05-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.[ch]: removed member "accelerator". 
	It was never set and this is the conceptually wrong place to store
	it anyway.

	* app/actions/file-dialog-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c
	* app/xcf/xcf.c: changed accordingly.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb (plugins_query): always return NULL
	as accelerator. Cleaned up the function a bit and made it aware of
	proc_def->menu_label added below.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-05-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Changed plug-in menu registration again to allow passing just the
	menu item's label (not the full path) in gimp_install_procedure()
	and only the path (excluding the item's label) in
	gimp_plugin_menu_register(). Matches the internal action system
	better and makes translating the menu paths much easier.

	(Of yourse it's still possible to use the old syntax for backward
	compatibility).

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.[ch]: added "gchar *menu_label".

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-params.[ch]: added new functions
	plug_in_param_defs_check() and plug_in_proc_args_check() which
	check if a procedure's parameters match its menu location
	(e.g. <Image> needs RUN-MODE, IMAGE, DRAWABLE).

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_install): if
	registering an old-style (full) menu_path, use
	plug_in_param_defs_check(), set proc_def->menu_label otherwise.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb (plugin_menu_register): use
	plug_in_proc_args_check() on the passed menu_path and make sure
	old and new style menu registration are not mixed.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c: regenerated.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-rc.c: save/restore "menu_label".

	* app/actions/file-dialog-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c
	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c: changed action/menu creation
	accordingly. Some hacks needed to allow both old and new style
	menu_label/menu_paths.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c
	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c
	* app/xcf/xcf.c: changed accordingly.

	plain crash when an indexed image doesn't have a colormap.

	* plug-ins/common/png.c: keep at least one entry in the colormap.
	Fixes bug #142029.

2004-05-06  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

2004-05-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/about-dialog.c: center the about dialog on the monitor,
	not on the screen. Fixes window position on xinerama setups.

2004-05-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb: renamed gimp_plugin_menu_add() to
	gimp_plugin_menu_register() for consistency with other
	gimp_plugin_foo_register() functions which can be called during
	query().

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpplugin_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/common/ccanalyze.c
	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c
	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c
	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c: changed accordingly.

2004-05-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	gimp_plugin_menu_add() which can be called during query() and adds
	a menu path to a procedure registered by the calling plugin.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpplugin_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml.in: added lots of <placeholder>s for
	logical groups (like Image/Resize, Image/Scale, Image/Crop
	etc.). Added empty placeholder File/Send for stuff like print and
	mail. Added an "Acquire" menu under <Image>/File

	* plug-ins/common/mail.c
	* plug-ins/print/print.c
	* plug-ins/common/winprint.c: register under File/Send.

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c

	reorganizing the plug-in menus.

2004-05-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/resize-dialog.[ch]: cleaned up variable names and
	external API. Still quite a mess.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/image-commands.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: changed accordingly.

2004-05-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: changed #includes accordingly.

2004-05-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/file-new-dialog.c: use a normal GimpDialog instead of a
	GimpViewableDialog that never has a viewable set.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/brush-select.[ch] (brush_select_new): reordered parameters 
	so the first four are the same for all foo_select_new() functions.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brush_select.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/brush_select_cmds.c: regenerated.

	* app/gui/font-select.c (font_select_new): set the vbox'

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/debug-actions.c
	* app/actions/debug-commands.[ch]

	all UI managers.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c (plug_in_actions_add_proc): fixed
	bug which would have leaked broken menu translations.

	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.c: removed useless #includes.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-actions.c
	* app/actions/file-commands.[ch]: remove "file-close" action and
	callback...

	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: ...and added it here as
	"view-close" because that's what it does.

	* app/actions/qmask-actions.c
	* app/actions/qmask-commands.c: s/QMask/QuickMask/g

	* app/gui/menus.c: add the "channels" action group to the <Image>
	and <Dock> UI managers, renamed UI manager <Dialogs> to
	<Dockable>.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.c: s/<Dialogs>/<Dockable>/.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: s/file-close/view-close/, added
	separators at the end of most menus, moved the bottom group of the
	"View" menu after the zoom group.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/select-actions.c: removed action "select-by-color".

	* app/tools/gimpbycolorselecttool.c: add the shortcut here.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c: added alternative tool actions for
	"by-color-select" and "rotate" which are identical to the ones
	generated from the GimpToolInfo except for their label. Make sure
	they have the same accelerators as the generated ones.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: use the alternative actions for
	"<Image>/Select/By Color" and
	"<Layer>/Transform/Arbitrary Rotation...".

2004-05-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimphelpui.c: documentation.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Finally enable global accelerators in all docks:

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.c (gimp_image_dock_constructor):
	iterate all of the UI manager's actions and enable their
	accelerators manually. Fixes bug #119878.

2004-05-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpviewabledialog.c: added construct properties to
	make it possible to derive from GimpViewableDialog.

	* app/widgets/gimptooldialog.[ch]: make GimpToolDialog a real
	object, not just a convenience constructor.
	
	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: set a smaller border_width of 6 pixels for
	the action area of tool dialogs.

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c
	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c: set a smaller border_width of 6
	pixels on tool dialogs to make them more compact.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpoffsetarea.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_offset_area_set_pixbuf(). Started to clean up the
	code a bit.

	* app/gui/resize-dialog.c (resize_widget_new): use the new feature
	and set a preview of the image. Fixes bug #78733.

2004-05-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/info-dialog.c
	* app/tools/gimpcolorbalancetool.c

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimphuesaturationtool.c
	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c: use GimpFrame widgets, changed spacings.

	* app/widgets/gimptexteditor.c: tweaked.

2004-05-05  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* data/images/gimp_splash.png: ustable splash

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/menus.c: register a <Dock> UI manager which has all
	action groups <Image> has except "view".

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.[ch]: re-enabled the global shortcuts,
	using UI manager instead of item factory. Unfortunately actions
	without proxy widgets can't be activated so this change is pretty
	useless. Oh well, will find a hack to work around this later...

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpblendoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilloptions.c

	was used. Put "Pressure Sensitivity" frame into a GtkExpander.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c: added a style property to control
	boldening of the frame title.
	
	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: suppress the bold title for GimpFrames in
	GimpDockables,

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c (gimp_frame_size_allocate): allocate
	the full width for the label widget, looks better and is more
	convenient to use with activatable widgets such as toggle buttons.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c: removed debugging output, added
	#warning about runtime version check that can be removed as soon
	as we depend on GTK+ 2.4.1.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-dialog-actions.c (file_dialog_actions_setup):
	don't forget to set the action's accelerator.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/channels-commands.c
	* app/actions/gradient-editor-commands.c

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpquerybox.c: set dialog border spacing to 12.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_window_set_hint): added
	new window hint "keep-above" to force toolbox and/or dock windows
	to be kept above (if the WM supports this hint). Fixes bug #131672.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fix bug #141719:

	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c (gimp_move_tool_motion): use RINT()
	instead of ROUND() to round double coords to guide positions.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): pass RINT()-rounded
	coords to gimp_display_shell_update_cursor() instead of implicitly
	truncating by casting to int.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.c: removed code duplication by adding
	utility function gimp_undo_editor_update_buttons(), some general
	cleanups.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_undo_freeze,thaw): emit the
	"undo-freeze" and "undo-thaw" signals only on the first freeze and
	last thaw, not on any of them.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: added GIMP_HELP_EDIT_UNDO_CLEAR.

	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.[ch]: added a "Clear Undo History"
	button. Fixes bug #136300.

	Also don't attach to the image's undo stack if the image's undo is
	disabled and set the buttons' sensitivity accordingly. Should fix
	all kinds of unpredictable undo history brokenness.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Treat FG/BG just like all other context properties:

	* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.h: added GIMP_CONTEXT_FOREGROUND_MASK
	and _BACKGROUND_MASK to GIMP_PAINT_OPTIONS_CONTEXT_MASK to specify
	that they are used by GimpPaintOptions (automatically affects all
	paint tools).

	* app/tools/gimpblendtool.c
	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilltool.c
	* app/tools/gimpinktool.c: set FOREGROUND_MASK and BACKGROUND_MASK
	manually here.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c (tool_manager_tool_changed): decide
	about the globality of FG and BG at the same place where we decide
	about the brush's, pattern's etc. globality, but hardcode them to
	global = TRUE instead of looking at GimpConfig.

	Fixes bug #141786.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c (sobel_dialog): removed frame, adjusted
	spacing, fixes bug #141773.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/stroke-dialog.c: 
	* app/widgets/gimpstrokeeditor.c: moved line style options into a
	GtkExpander. Changed dialog spacings.

2004-05-03  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/qmask-actions.c: initialize is_active for qmask-toggle.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c: set entry help_id from tool_info,
	since gimp_action_group_add_string_actions expects it to be there
	now.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c (gimp_frame_new): added a hack that
	allows to get the label_spacing but no label. Useful when the frame
	is packed into a GtkExpander.

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: pack the "Image Comment" frame
	into a GtkExpander to reduce clutter and dialog size.

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimphelpui.[ch]: added gimp_help_id_quark()
	which is G_GNUC_CONST and a new macro GIMP_HELP_ID as shortcut.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c (gimp_action_group_add_*_actions):
	attach the help ID to the action using the new quark key. Call
	gtk_action_group_add_action() instead of the _with_accel() variant
	if the accel is the empty string (== if we explicitely want no
	accel even if the stock item specifies one). Fixes warning flood
	with GTK+ 2.4.1.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c: if the label_widget is a button, set
	the button label as bold. Cache the indentation instead of
	calculating it over and over again.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc: set HIG-compliant spacing for the
	action_area.

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.[ch]: added
	gimp_prop_enum_radio_box_new() for a radio group that is no
	embedded in a frame.

	* app/widgets/gimpstrokeeditor.c: use a frame-less radio box for
	the Stroke style.

	* app/gui/file-new-dialog.c
	* app/gui/grid-dialog.c
	* app/gui/stroke-dialog.c: HIG-compliant spacings.

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c (gimp_dock_key_press_event): new function
	which overrides GtkWindow's default handler in order to give the
	focus widget precedence over accelerators for keys without any
	modifier or with <Shift> modifier. Enables e.g. having a <Shift>+s
	accelerator while still being able to enter 'S' in an entry.
	Thanks to Tim Janik for the code.

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-commands.c: removed them here. Some cleanup.

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/actions.[ch]: added some utility functions to get a
	Gimp, GimpImage, GimpDisplay and GtkWidget from the "data" pointer
	passed to action callbacks.

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c
	* app/actions/channels-commands.c

	* app/actions/view-commands.c: use the new functions instead of
	duplicating insane macros and if() constructs over and over again.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c: use a GimpFrame for
	gimp_radio_group_new() and friends.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: set a smaller label_spacing for GimpFrame
	widgets in GimpDockables. Lame hack to keep the tool options
	compact.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c: changed spacing.

	* app/gui/offset-dialog.c: merged check and radio buttons into a
	single radio button group; changed spacing.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c (gimp_frame_size_allocate): respect
	the frame's border width.

	* app/actions/dockable-commands.c (dockable_add_tab_cmd_callback):
	truncate the passed dialog identifier at the first '|'. Fixes
	creating brushes, paterns etc. dialogs from the dockables'
	"Add Tab" menu.

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c (gimp_frame_size_request): take the

	title label and the frame content.

2004-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/qmask-actions.c: renamed action "qmask-toggle" to
	"qmask-active" and added new action "qmask-toggle" with a label
	and shortcut suited for the "Select" menu.

	* app/actions/select-actions.c: removed "select-toggle-qmask".

	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]: removed callback
	select_toggle_quickmask_cmd_callback().

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c (channels_actions_update)
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c (vectors_actions_update): handle
	"data" being both GimpDisplay and GimpDisplayShell so the actions
	can be used in the image menu.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: s/select-toggle-qmask/qmask-toggle/.

	* menus/qmask-menu.xml: s/qmask-toggle/qmask-active/.

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* menus/tool-options-menu.xml
	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml.in: use empty elements for empty menus.
	Makes the XML somewhat easier to read.

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* menus/dialogs-menuitems.xml: new file that holds menuitems that
	appear in several places.

2004-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/file-dialog-actions.[ch]: new files containing
	factored out code to set up the <Load> and <Save> actions.
	Use GimpPlugInActions instead of just GtkActions.

	* app/actions/file-dialog-commands.[ch]: new files containing
	file_dialog_type_cmd_callback() which is a
	GimpPlugInAction::selected() callback now.

	* app/actions/file-commands.[ch]: removed the callback here.

	* app/actions/file-open-actions.c
	* app/actions/file-save-actions.c: removed code duplication and
	use file_dialog_actions_setup() instead.

2004-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/*-actions.c: added help IDs to all actions
	representing the toplevel popups and menus (as fallbacks for the
	still-to-be-written help system intrgration of GimpUIManager).

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_new): removed
	call to gtk_ui_manager_ensure_update() because that's done by
	gimp_ui_manager_ui_get() now.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.[ch]: removed API to register and
	create item factories.

	* app/gui/menus.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: removed leftover item factory
	cruft.

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: removed item factory typedefs...

	* app/widgets/gimpitemfactory.h: ...and added them here.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_action_group_add_plug_in_actions().

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: use it here instead of adding
	the actions manually.

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c: ported the code which dynamically
	updates the tool button tooltips on accelerator changes to
	GtkAction. Disabled the whole stuff because GTK+ lacks
	gtk_action_get_accel_closure().

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am: added a rule to generate gtkuimanager XML
	files using an XSL transformation.

	* menus/menus.xsl: a simple XSLT to generate a menubar and a popup
	menu with identical content.

	* menus/image-menu.xml: removed this file from CVS ...

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: ... and added this instead.

	* HACKING: xsltproc is now needed to build from CVS.

2004-05-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: check for xmllint and xsltproc but don't require
	these tools.

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* tips/Makefile.am: simplified "validate" targets.

2004-04-30  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.c: Cleanups.
	(gimp_rect_select_tool_coords_to_integer): Undo my bogus fix for
	bug #138103, which led to bug #140649.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c (procedural_db_init_procs): Add missing
	compat procs: gimp_channel_ops_duplicate, gimp_channel_ops_offset.

2004-04-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/tool-options-menu.c: added casts to please the compiler.

2004-04-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added signal "update" which
	is G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST, so handlers can hook in before and after
	the default implementation. Update the action groups
	in the default implementations.

	(gimp_ui_manager_ui_get): make sure we always return a widget
	by calling gtk_ui_manager_ensure_update().

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c (gimp_dockable_show_menu): make
	sure the dockable menu is loaded before trying to access its
	widgets/actions.

	Resurrected the dynamic tool options menus:

	* app/actions/tool-options-actions.c: dynamically destroy/create
	actions for the tool options' presets.

	* app/actions/tool-options-commands.[ch]: all callbacks are
	GimpEnumAction::selected() callbacks now.

	* app/gui/tool-options-menu.[ch]: connect and connect_after to
	GimpUIManager::update(). Remove the old preset menu items
	in the former callback, create the new ones in the latter.
	Removed the last item factory entries.

	* app/gui/menus.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c: changed accordingly.

2004-04-29  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c: when glibc is used, call mallopt, so that memory
	chunks >= 4k (= 64*64 pixels, 1bpp - the smallest full tile)
	get allocated via mmap. This ensures that after closing an image
	the memory allocated for image data gets returned to the system.

	Thanks to Phil Blundell <pb@nexus.co.uk> for bringing mallopt
	to my attention.

	Please watch closely for performance problems.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/file-open-actions.[ch]

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]: ditto.

	* app/actions/actions.c

	* app/gui/file-open-dialog.c
	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.c: removed debugging code which
	automatically loaded all registered menus. They are now loaded on
	demand only.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.[ch] (gimp_escape_uline): new function
	which does the opposite of gimp_strip_uline().

	* app/actions/file-actions.c (file_actions_last_opened_update):
	escape ulines in filenames so they don't end up as mnemonics.
	Spotted by Pedro Gimeno.

2004-04-29  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/py-slice.py: Quick fix to make uppercase
	tags work properly.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimp*tool.c (gimp_*_tool_register): stripped the menu
	paths from the "menu_path". Will be renamed to "action_name" or
	something soon...

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/dbbrowser.c
	* plug-ins/common/plugindetails.c
	* plug-ins/common/uniteditor.c: register under the new
	"Extensions" placeholder.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Switch from GtkItemFactory to GtkUIManager. The migration is
	almost complete, still stuff missing/incomplete, definitely added
	a bunch of new bugs...

	* app/actions/*-commands.[ch]: converted all callback from
	GtkItemFactory callbacks to GtkAction callbacks.

	* app/actions/debug-actions.c
	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/help-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: move everything from
	GtkItemFactory to GtkUIManager.

	* app/gui/dialogs.[ch]: added new function dialogs_get_toolbox().
	Needed because the action callbacks don't have a widget parameter
	and sometimes we need a parent window for showing dialogs.

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/brushes-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/buffers-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/channels-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/colormap-editor-menu.[ch]

	menu and the toolbox menubar.

	* app/gui/menus.[ch]: removed all GtkItemFactory code.

	* app/gui/image-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/toolbox-menu.[ch]: removed everything except the trivial
	setup_funcs.

	* app/gui/file-open-menu.c
	* app/gui/file-save-menu.c
	* app/gui/tool-options-menu.c: don't use the macros from menus.h
	any more, they are gone.

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c
	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.[ch]: create/destroy the dynamic plug-in
	menu entries.

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c: s/gimp_item_factory_update/
	gimp_ui_manager_update/g

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added API to get an action
	group by name.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.c: don't choke on the item_factory
	entries being NULL.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c: make sure booleans set using
	g_object_set() only have TRUE or FALSE values.

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.[ch]

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c: removed all GtkItemFactory
	code and enable the #if 0'ed UI manager stuff.

	* menus/gradient-editor-menu.xml: fixed typos.

	* menus/image-menu.xml: duplicate everything so we have both
	an image menubar and an image popup menu. Badly cries for an
	XSL processor.

	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml: added an "Extensions" placeholder.

2004-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimppluginaction.[ch]: new GtkAction subclass which
	remembers the PlugInProcDef.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: added "gpointer user_data" to
	the GimpActionGroup struct and to gimp_action_group_new(). Removed
	the user_data parameter from gimp_action_group_add_*_actions().

	* app/widgets/gimpactionfactory.[ch]: changed accordingly.

	* app/actions/*-actions.[ch]: removed user_data from all setup_funcs.

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: use a GimpPlugInAction and
	finally use the right user_data for the callback so plug-in
	callbacks have a proper context.

	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.[ch]: renamed plug_in_menus_create2() to
	plug_in_menus_setup().

	* app/gui/image-menu.c
	* app/gui/toolbox-menu.c: changed accordingly.

2004-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: removed "translation-domain"
	property and simply use gettext(). Plug-In domains are handled
	by plug-in-actions.c

	The following change finally starts breaking the old menu system
	while the new one is not fully in place yet. Have fun:

	* menus/image-menu.xml: added several <placeholder>s for plug-ins
	to register their menu entries in the middle of already existing
	menus.

	* app/gui/menus.c
	* plug-ins/common/mail.c
	* plug-ins/print/print.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: use the new
	placeholders to register menu entries.

2004-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Correctly translated & sorted plug-in actions & menu entries:

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added a "gchar *name" property
	and a hash table which keeps all created UI managers (similar to
	GimpActionGroup's hash table). Added function
	gimp_ui_managers_from_name() which returns a list of all managers
	with the given name.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.c: register a name per UI manager
	and pass the name to gimp_ui_manager_new().

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: added code which correctly
	translates the created plug-in actions and also creates translated
	menu actions for the plug-in's menu_path elements.

	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.[ch]: sort the plug-ins' menu entries
	using a GTree. For each entry, recursivlely create submenus
	from the dynamic menu actions created above before creating
	the plug-in's menu entry itself.

	* app/gui/image-menu.c (image_menu_setup2)
	* app/gui/toolbox-menu.c (toolbox_menu_setup2): call
	plug_in_menus_create2().

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c (gui_menus_create_entry)
	(gui_menus_delete_entry): added some uglyness which maps old <Prefix>
	menu identifiers to new-style UI manager plus ui_path tuples and
	call plug_in_menus_add,remove_proc() accordingly.

	* menus/image-menu.xml
	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml: added name="Foo" attributes to all menus
	so plug-in entries find their place.

2004-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_restore_callback): call actions_init()
	(gui_exit_after_callback): call actions_exit().

	* app/gui/menus.c (menus_init)
	(menu_exit): don't call them here.

2004-04-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: added GimpUIManagerSetupFunc typedef.

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added the setup_func to the
	GimpUIManagerUIEntry struct and to gimp_ui_manager_ui_register().
	Call the setup_func after creating the UI. Replaced the term
	"identifier" by "ui_path".

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.c: ditto.

	* app/gui/menus.c (menus_init): register the new setup_funcs below.

	* app/gui/menus.[ch] (menus_open_recent_add)
	* app/gui/image-menu.[ch] (image_menu_setup2)
	* app/gui/toolbox-menu.[ch] (toolbox_menu_setup2): new setup_funcs
	which add the "Open Recent" menu items.

	* app/actions/file-actions.c: removed "file-open-recent-empty"
	action because it's not needed.

	* menus/image-menu.xml
	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml: removed "file-open-recent-empty" menu
	items and added <placeholder>s for the "Open Recent" menu items.

2004-04-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp.[ch]: removed "locale_domain" and "help_domain"
	parameters from GimpMenusCreateFunc.

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c (plug_ins_temp_proc_def_add)
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.[ch] (plug_in_actions_add_proc_def):
	changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: remember all created action
	groups is a hash table in GimpActionGroupClass.  Added
	gimp_action_groups_from_name() which returns a GList of all groups
	with the given name.

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.[ch] (plug_in_actions_setup):
	removed the tree sorting code. Actions don't need to be ordered
	alphabetically.

	(plug_in_actions_update): copied & ported plug_in_menus_update().

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c (gui_menus_create,delete_entry):
	dynamically add/remove plug-in actions in all "plug-in" action
	groups.

2004-04-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp.[ch]: changed GimpMenusDeleteFunc to take
	a PlugInProcDef* instead of a const gchar*.

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c
	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c
	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.[ch]: changed accordingly.

2004-04-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/AlienMap2.c: some UI improvements based on a
	patch by William Skaggs (bug #140079).

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: silent the compiler.

	* plug-ins/winicon/icodialog.c: simplified by using a
	GimpIntComboBox.

2004-04-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: remember and ref the created
	widgets.  Added gimp_ui_manager_ui_popup() which pops up a GtkMenu
	with a custom GimpMenuPositionFunc and a GtkDestroyNotify which is
	called on popdown.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.c (gimp_menu_factory_finalize):
	don't forget to free the list of managed UIs.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpdocked.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.[ch]: added GimpUIManager stuff parallel
	to the to-be-removed GtkItemFactory stuff.

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimperrorconsole.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c: changed accordingly and added
	#if 0'ed code which actually uses all the UI managers.

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c: disabled some gimp_ui_manager_update()
	calls because they were invoking toggle and radio callbacks
	which still have the wrong signature.

2004-04-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c: ported the last plug-in from
	GtkOptionMenu to GimpIntComboBox.

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: changed a comment that was still
	talking about option menus.

2004-04-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/menus.c (menus_init): fixed some typos in the UI Manager
	registration code.

2004-04-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: implemented
	gimp_action_group_set_action_color() and
	gimp_action_group_set_action_viewable().

	* app/actions/*-actions.c: added stock IDs to all actions which
	represent toplevel popup menus. Fixed typos.

	* menus/brushes-menu.xml
	* menus/colormap-editor-menu.xml
	* menus/dockable-menu.xml
	* menus/gradients-menu.xml
	* menus/patterns-menu.xml
	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml: fixed typos.

2004-04-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_callback.[ch]
	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_dialog.c: ported from GtkOptionMenu to
	GimpIntComboBox.

2004-04-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintstore.[ch]: automatically add an "(Empty)"
	item if the store is empty and remove it as soon as other items
	are being added.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablecombobox.c
	* libgimp/gimpimagecombobox.c: removed handling of the empty list;
	the store does this for us now.

2004-04-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintcombobox.c (gimp_int_combo_box_new):
	removed the check for first_label != NULL. Passing a NULL label
	makes a perfect empty combo_box.

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c
	* plug-ins/common/spheredesigner.c: ported from GtkOptioMenu to
	GimpIntComboBox.

2004-04-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/brush.c: ported the last two users of
	gimpmenu.h to GimpDrawableComboBox.

	* libgimp/gimpmenu.[ch]: declared the functions found here as
	deprecated.

	* plug-ins/common/plugindetails.c
	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: silent the compiler.

2004-04-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablecombobox.c 
	* libgimp/gimpimagecombobox.c
	* libgimp/gimpmenu.c: changed the label for the empty menu from
	"None" to "Empty" since that's what GTK+ uses.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintcombobox.[ch]: added convenience function
	gimp_int_combo_box_connect().
	
	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c
	* plug-ins/common/compose.c
	* plug-ins/common/depthmerge.c
	* plug-ins/common/displace.c
	* plug-ins/common/lic.c
	* plug-ins/common/warp.c: ported to GimpDrawableComboBox.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c
	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c
	* plug-ins/common/sample_colorize.c: use

	William Skaggs which changes the sub menu title for the gimp web

	mnemonic. Fixes bug #139868.

2004-04-17  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c (save_dialog): live preview doesn't
	modify the undo history of the image anymore, label changed

2004-04-16  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* plug-ins/common/tile.c (tile): changed a call to
	gimp_image_undo_enable to _undo_disable which was obviously the

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c
	* app/tools/gimpmeasuretool.c: don't use gtk_window_present() to
	raise the tool dialog since it also moves the focus away from the
	image window. Fixes the problem described in bug #139349.

2004-04-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: some code cleanup that I forgot to do

	* tools/Makefile.am

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c: since we now depend on pango 1.4, we can
	use pango_fc_font_description_from_pattern() instead of our
	cut-n-paste function, gimp_font_list_font_desc_from_pattern().

2004-04-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_install)
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.h (struct _PlugInProcDef)

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c (plug_ins_init): Make PDB procedures
	(including their menu entries) installed during a plug-ins init()
	phase show up. Add a flag to PlugInProcDef that tells whether the
	proc was installed during the init() phase. Such procs aren't
	saved to the pluginrc. Move the code that initializes plug-ins
	that need initialization earlier, before the procs are added to
	the PDB and menus are built. Fixes bug #139969.

2004-04-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/AlienMap.c: removed the AlienMap plug-in since
	AlienMap2 duplicates its functionality.

	* plug-ins/common/AlienMap2.c: applied patch from William Skaggs
	with a couple of user interface improvements (bug #140079).

2004-04-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* libgimpthumb/Makefile.am: For Win32, install gimpthumb.def, like
	the .def files of the other libgimp* libs.

	* app/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add PANGOFT2_CFLAGS.

	* gimp-zip.in: Put also libgimpthumb in the developer package.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/winicon/icodialog.c: fixed gtk+ includes, added a
	warning that deprecated widgets are being used.

	* plug-ins/winicon/icoload.[ch]
	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.[ch]
	* plug-ins/winicon/main.[ch]: added plug-in to load and save
	Windows icon files. Plug-in written by Christian Kreibich, port to
	GIMP-2.0 API by Gregor Riepl, massive code cleanup by me. Fixes
	bug #139160.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c (gimp_dnd_data_source_add)
	(gimp_dnd_data_source_remove): use the new dynamic GtkTargetList
	based API for changing the widget's drag source types.

	* app/widgets/gimpdocumentview.c (gimp_document_view_new): simply
	call gimp_dnd_file_source_add() instead of duplicating the whole
	GtkTargetEntry array insanity just for adding one source type.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.c
	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: first plug-ins ported to GtkFileChooser.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c: removed runtime version
	checks and workarounds for bugs which are fixed in GTK+ 2.4.

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c
	(gimp_file_dialog_selection_changed): added runtime check for GTK+
	2.4.1 and work around GtkFileChooser's missing "update_preview"
	functionality for multiple selections if the dependency is not
	met.

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_menu_position)
	(gimp_menu_button_position): call gtk_menu_set_monitor() until
	bug #139187 is fixed.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]: derive it from GtkFileChooser
	instead of GtkFileSelection.

	* app/gui/file-dialog-utils.c
	* app/gui/file-open-dialog.c
	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c

	allows to keep the aspect ratio fixed.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayermask.c (gimp_layer_mask_class_init): set
	translate_desc to "Move Layer Mask".

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c: take the undo desc
	from the moved item's class instead of duplicating all
	strings here.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppalette-import.[ch]
	* app/gui/palette-import-dialog.c: added palette import from RIFF
	palette files based on a patch from ÃRDI GergÃµ (bug #129788).

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/xcf/xcf.c (xcf_save_invoker) (xcf_load_invoker): forgot
	to add context parameters to this non-generated PDB invokers.
	Fixes XCF loading/saving.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: added "const gchar *stroke_desc" to
	the GimpItemClass struct and always push an undo group
	around GimpItem::stroke().

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c
	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c: set the stroke_desc accordingly
	and don't push undo groups.

	* app/text/gimptextlayer.c (gimp_text_layer_class_init): set
	all of GimpItemClass' undo_descs.

	* app/text/gimptextlayer-transform.c: don't push undo groups here.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/gimpcolorspace.c (gimp_rgb_to_hsv): applied patch
	from Marco Munari that removes a redundant "if" (bug #133540).

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: applied patch from Yeti that
	adds spinbuttons instead of simple text entries (bug #138132).

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/gicon.c: removed the GIcon plug-in (addresses
	one aspect of bug #139160).

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Context cleanup continued:

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: added context parameter to
	GimpItem::stroke().

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c (gimp_channel_stroke)
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c (gimp_vectors_stroke): use it to get
	default values from instead of gimp_get_user_context().

	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* app/gui/stroke-dialog.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/edit.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c

	struct. Added context parameter to plug_in_new(),
	plug_in_call_query() and plug_in_call_init().

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.[ch]: added context parameters to
	plug_in_run() and plug_in_repeat().

	* app/gui/plug-in-commands.c
	* app/gui/vectors-commands.c
	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c
	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c: pass a context to plug_in_run() and
	plug_in_repeat().

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_run): call
	procedures with the plug-in's context.

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c: use a temporary context for running the
	plug-ins' query() and init() functions. Use the same context for
	running automatic extensions. This temporarily separates the main
	Script-Fu extension from the user context (i.e. scripts have no
	way of setting/getting the global FG, BG, brush etc.).

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS
	* README: mention that this is the development branch.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.[ch]: 
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-generic.h: header cleanup, added
	some const qualifiers, converted tabs to spaces. Fixes bug #140115
	for the HEAD branch.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Get rid of the "current_context" which was in fact just a bunch of
	global variables. Instead, pass the needed context all the way
	from the GUI and the PDB to the core. This is a prerequisite for
	macro recording and generally helps separating the various
	subsystems from each other. Work in progress...

	* app/core/gimp.[ch]: removed member "current_context" and
	gimp_[get|set]_current_context().

2004-04-14  RaphaÃ«l Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: New version of the
	script that works on a temporary copy of the image instead of
	copying the visible layers.  Fixes bug #139989.

2004-04-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/film.c: fixed typo (bug #140039).

2004-04-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.1.0, interface age 0, binary
	age 0. Changed library versioning to include gimp_minor_version
	similar to how gtk+ does it.
	
2004-04-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.0.1 release.

2004-04-13  RaphaÃ«l Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mng.c (query, run): Workaround for bug #139947:
	do not register the plug-in for INDEXED* modes and do not declare
	that it can handle INDEXED images in gimp_export_image().  This
	forces a conversion to RGB instead of generating broken indexed
	images.  The generation of correct indexed MNG files is likely to
	require a newer release of libmng.
	(mng_data): Set default compression level to 9 instead of 6.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_cern_parse.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_csim_parse.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_ncsa_parse.c: regenerated using GNU Bison
	version 1.875a. Fixes bug #139894.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c: reverted last change and go back to the
	solution using fork(). Hopefully fixes bug #139158 this time.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-utils.[ch] (gimp_get_default_language): added a
	category parameter to make this function more flexible.

	* app/text/gimptext.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c (gimp_help): localize the help pages
	according to the value of LC_MESSAGES. Fixes bug #139917.

2004-04-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Moved the calls to floating_sel_relax()/rigor() from various
	places to two single spots in the core where they are actually
	needed. Fixes bug #138356 (which was caused by the projection
	being triggered in the middle of changing the floating selection's
	size or the size of the drawable it is attached to). This commit
	effectively removes floating selection fiddling from the core's
	public API.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch] (gimp_drawable_has_floating_sel): new
	function which returns TRUE if there is a floating selection
	attached to the drawable.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_translate)
	(gimp_drawable_set_tiles_full): if the drawable *has* a floating
	selection, relax/rigor it before/after modifying the drawable.

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_translate)
	(gimp_layer_set_tiles): if the layer *is* the floating selection,
	relax/rigor it before/after modifying it.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-crop.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-flip.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-resize.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-rotate.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-scale.c
	* app/gui/layers-commands.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: removed calls to
	floating_sel_rigor()/relax() all over the place. Also removed
	lots of undo groups which are obsolete now.

	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_file.c (do_file_error_dialog): convert
	the filename to UTF-8 before displaying it.

2004-04-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	GimpItem undo group cleanup in preparation of fixing bug #138356:

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: renamed LAYER_SCALE and LAYER_RESIZE
	undo groups to ITEM_SCALE and ITEM_RESIZE.

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: always push undo groups around
	GimpItem::translate(), scale(), resize(), flip(), rotate() and
	transform(). Added the resp. undo_desc strings to GimpItemClass.

	* app/core/gimpchannel.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* app/core/gimplayer.c: removed all undo groups from
	implementations of the above methods. Removed the undo_desc
	strings which were moved to GimpItemClass.

	* app/core/gimpimage-crop.c
	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* app/gui/layers-commands.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-04-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: cleaned up the check for Xmu. Include <gdk/gdkx.h>
	when testing for Xmu.h. Fixes bug #139803.

2004-04-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpmath/Makefile.am: remove test-md5 on make clean.

2004-04-11  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/py-slice.py: When using a separate dir for
	images, actually prepend the dir to the img srcs in the html. Allow
	only horizontal or vertical guides in an image, do not require both.
	A bit smarter path handling. Addresses most of bug #138714.

2004-04-11  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* app/makefile.msc : build sanity.obj
	  app/text/makefile.msc : gimptextundo.obj
	  app/widgets/makefile.msc : gimppatternfactoryview.obj

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c : don't call 
	gimp_image_undo_enable() when it's not switched off. 
	Otherwise the undo history would be destroyed with
	Gimp-Core-CRITICAL **: file gimpimage.c: line 1579: assertion 
	`gimage->undo_freeze_count > 0' failed

2004-04-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_apply): push an undo
	group only when it's needed. This resurrects text undo compression
	that broke when bug #137767 got fixed.

2004-04-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* docs/gimp-remote.1.in: updated example URL.

2004-04-10  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): Applied patch from William
	Skaggs that addresses bug #120490.

	* app/sanity.c (sanity_check): Modified the message that reports
	an old version of Fontconfig in an attempt to make it more
	informative.

2004-04-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c (start_new_gimp): reverted the last change
	and did a different fix that involves closing the X display before
	starting gimp (bug #139158).

2004-04-09  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Uglier workaround for bug #138357, since
	the previous one did break error handling. Fixes bug #139571.

2004-04-09  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* README.i18n: s/14/20/ plus whitespace clean-up.

2004-04-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: applied a patch from Kevin
	Cozens that makes the Script-Fu PDB marshaller handle NULL
	strings. Some minor code cleanup. Fixes bug #139386.

2004-04-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c (start_new_gimp): applied a patch from
	Michael Matz that calls fork() before starting gimp. This is to
	avoid X server authentification problems (bug #139158).

2004-04-07  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): revert addition of "is" until all
	.po files are there.

2004-04-07  SamÃºel JÃ³n Gunnarsson  <sammi@techattack.nu>

	* configure.in: Added "is" to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-04-06  IÃ±aki LarraÃ±aga  <dooteo@euskalgnu.org>

	* configure.in: Added "eu" (Basque) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-04-05  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: Use
	gimp-image-get-active-layer/channel instead of the passed
	drawable for later restoring the initially active layer/channel.
	Addresses bug #138662.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/drop-shadow.scm: Add a call to
	gimp-image-set-active-layer in order for it to fail early instead
	of failing with the undo group open in case the drawable is not
	suitable for applying the effect.

2004-04-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_real_mode_changed): update the
	whole image.

	* app/display/gimpdisplay-handlers.c: removed obsolete
	"mode_changed" and "colormap_changed" handlers because GimpImage's
	default handlers already update the whole image.

2004-04-05  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	Sanitize rectangle and ellipse selection handling (bug #138237
	and bug #138103):

	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.h
	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.c (GimpRectSelectTool): new
	member "moved" indicating whether the cursor was moved after
	the click.
	(gimp_rect_select_tool_coords_to_integer): New function for
	consistent conversion of the rectangle FP coords to pixels.
	(gimp_rect_select_tool_button_press,
	gimp_rect_select_tool_button_release,
	gimp_rect_select_tool_motion, gimp_rect_select_tool_draw): use
	it instead of fiddling with the FP coordinates. Update "moved"
	and use it to detect whether the selection needs to be cleared.

	* app/tools/gimpellipseselecttool.c
	(gimp_ellipse_select_tool_draw): use the new coords_to_integer
	function.

2004-04-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c: applied the second patch
	attached to bug #138788 by William Skaggs. Removes some user
	interface elements that have no corresponding implementation and
	fixes preview updates.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* NEWS.pre-2-0: moved old NEWS to this new file.

	* NEWS: list bugs fixed since 2.0.0.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* docs/Makefile.am: don't install gimptool symlinks to
	gimptool-2.0 and its manpage. gimp.m4 as installed with gimp-1.2
	looks for gimptool (bug #139024).

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-draw.[ch] pass the bounding box of
	the exposed area to gimp_display_shell_draw_grid() and draw only
	the relevant part of the grid. Fixes bug #138081.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Cache the GC for drawing the grid as suggested in bug #138081:

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: added a grid_gc member to
	GimpDisplayShell.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	(gimp_display_shell_grid_notify_handler)
	(gimp_display_shell_disconnect): invalidate the grid GC.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-draw.c (gimp_display_shell_draw_grid):
	use the cached grid_gc. Also applied the fix that Pedro Gimeno did
	for bug #138606.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpundo.c (gimp_undo_type_to_name): added a missing
	call to gettext(). Fixes bug #139000.

2004-04-03  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimptool-2.0.in: Create any directories in the install path that do
	not already exist. Fixes bug #138980.

	* docs/gimptool.1.in: s/dont/don't/g

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimagemap.c (gimp_image_map_apply): do nothing if the
	selection is empty. Fixes bug #138973.

2004-04-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimptextlayer.c (gimp_text_layer_new): create the
	initial text layer with a size of 1 x 1 since tile_manager_new()
	does not any longer accept 0 x 0.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_configure): check that
	width and height are > 0.

2004-04-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_shade.c: applied the first of two
	patches attached to bug #138788 by William Skaggs.

2004-04-02  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/whirlpinch.c: set a proper pixelfetcher 
	edge mode for bigger radii. Avoids getting garbage at the
	image borders.

2004-04-02  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Added .jpe to the list of extensions 
	that the jpeg plug-in recognises. Fixes bug #138776.

2004-04-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/user-install-dialog.c: unset the bg_pixmap and tweak
	style colors for all states. Sort of ugly but makes the dialog
	work better with more obscure themes (bug #138379).

2004-04-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/kernelgen.c: updated a comment.

2004-04-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch] (enum GimpUndoType): added undo type
	GIMP_UNDO_TEXT_LAYER_MODIFIED and undo group types
	GIMP_UNDO_GROUP_DRAWABLE and GIMP_UNDO_GROUP_DRAWABLE_MOD.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.[ch]: added new new function
	gimp_image_undo_push_text_layer_modified() which makes
	modifications of the text_layer's "modified" boolean undoable.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]: added new virtual function
	GimpDrawable::push_undo() and moved the actual undo pushing into
	the default implementation gimp_drawable_real_push_undo().

	* app/text/gimptextlayer.c (gimp_text_layer_push_undo): new
	function. Pushes the text_layer's modified state to the undo stack
	after upchaining and sets modified to TRUE.

	(gimp_text_layer_set_tiles): ditto.

	(gimp_lext_layer_apply_region)
	(gimp_text_layer_replace_region): removed because their default
	implementations already call gimp_drawable_push_undo().

	(gimp_text_layer_swap_pixels): removed because swap_pixels() is
	used by undo only and doesn't need to care about the text_layer's
	modified state.

	(gimp_text_layer_render): don't set modified to FALSE here because
	we can't push an undo step here.

	(gimp_text_layer_set): push the modified state to the undo stack
	and set it to FALSE here. Also push the layer's tiles if the
	layer was modified.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_apply): push "modified"
	to the undo stack and set it to FALSE here, too.

	Fixes bug #137767.

2004-03-31  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: One really should use braces
	when mixing additions and multiplication and the operator
	precedence is not the desired one...

	I feel stupid...  :-)

2004-03-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-transform-utils.c
	(gimp_transform_matrix_perspective): make sure 0.0/0.0 results
	in 1.0, not NaN.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): instead of returning NULL
	if the transformation shrinks the tiles completely away, return at
	least the pixel (or the row or column of pixels) which best covers
	the sub-pixel area of the transform result:

	- Changed rounding of the transformed coordinates from RINT()
	  to floor()/ceil() so we don't cut off sub-pixel portions of the
	  transform result.
	- Force the minimal size if the changed rounding didn't help.

	Fixes bug #138117.

	Also added paranoia code which falls back to clip_result if the
	passed matrix produces NaN coordinates (copied the FINITE() macro
	from image_cmds.c).

2004-03-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/grid-system.scm: define "map" here,
	the script used to take the definition from alien-glow-arrow.scm
	or beveled-pattern-arrow.scm. Also added an undo group around all
	operations. Fixes bug #138524.

2004-03-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/sanity.[ch]: new files implementing sanity_check() for
	run-time checking library versions. Added a check for FreeType but
	disabled it until we figured if and how freetype causes some of
	the DLL hell bugs.

	* app/main.c (main): call it and abort if it fails.

	* app/app_procs.[ch]: added app_gui_abort() so main.c doesn't
	need to #include "gui/gui.h"

	* app/gui/gui.[ch] (gui_libs_init): removed library sanity checking.

	(gui_abort): new function which shows the abort message.

2004-03-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): revert addition of "pa" until
	all .po files are there.

2004-03-20  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "pa" for Punjabi to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-29  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c (struct my_error_mgr): Move setjump_buffer
	to the beginning of the structure, to make sure it is aligned on a
	16-byte boundary for ia64, even with icc. Fixes #138357.

2004-03-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.c: changed the default for "help-locales"
	from NULL to an empty string. Fixes the generated gimprc man-page.

	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h (HELP_LOCALES_BLURB): added missing
	whitespace.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c: use the user's locale if "help-locales"
	is NULL or the empty string.

	* docs/gimprc.5.in
	* etc/gimprc: regenerated.

2004-03-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch] (enum GimpUndoType): added new group
	GIMP_UNDO_GROUP_FS_REMOVE.

	* app/core/gimplayer-floating-sel.c (floating_sel_remove): push an
	undo group. Fixes undo corruption spotted by Pedro Gimeno.

2004-03-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/guillotine.c (guillotine): Don't just skip
	guides at the image edges but any guide which is at a position we
	already remembered. Should catch all instances of bug #138312 this
	time.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: applied patch from David Necas
	that updates the sensitivity of the Delete button and menu entry.
	Fixes bug #138212.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: fixed non-interactive call.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/spinning-globe.scm: pass -1 as
	drawable ID for unused drawables. Fixes bug #138253.
	
2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c (gimp_font_list_add_font): validate the
	font name. This should work around the crashes that Windows users
	were experiencing on startup (bug #132366). The real problem needs
	to be fixed elsewhere though.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_layer): when re-adding
	a layer with mask, don't forget to set layer->mask->removed to FALSE.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: added "gboolean removed" to the GimpItem
	struct. Defaults to FALSE. Set it to TRUE in gimp_item_removed().
	Added public function gimp_item_is_removed().

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_layer)
	(undo_pop_layer_mask) (undo_pop_channel) (undo_pop_vectors):
	set it to FALSE manually when re-adding something from the
	undo stack.

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb.pl: don't allow any operation on items which
	are removed from the image (and exist on the undo stack only).
	Fixes bug #138311.

	* app/pdb/channel_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/color_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/floating_sel_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/paint_tools_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/parasite_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/selection_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/selection_tools_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/transform_tools_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/slide.scm: applied a (modified) patch
	from Nils Philippsen that fixes bug #138310.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/guillotine.c (guillotine): applied a (modified)
	patch from Joao S. O. Bueno which removes any guides from the
	cropped images. Fixes bug #138314.

	Skip guides which are at the image's edges because the algorithm
	already assumes that there are always guides at these positions.
	Fixes bug #138312.

2004-03-27  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/help/Makefile.am (AM_LDFLAGS): Use -mwindows on Windows
	to avoid a console window popping up.

2004-03-26  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: don't generate code with tabs.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/procedural_db.pdb: convert tabs to spaces in
	helper function declaration.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c: convert tabs to spaces.

	* app/pdb/*.c: regenerated, no code changes, only tabs->spaces.

2004-03-26  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: kill whitespace in blank lines.

	* app/pdb/*.c: regenerated, no code changes, only whitespace.

2004-03-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): return NULL tiles if the
	matrix would transform the drawable into nothing. Fixes the
	core-crashing part of bug #138117 and makes the script fail
	with an execution error.

2004-03-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* README: mention the gimp-perl pre-release and provide a link.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/base/tile-manager.c (tile_manager_new): g_return_if_fail()
	on width, height or bpp <= 0. Doesn't fix anything but badly
	warns (and helps debugging) on bug #138117.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c (gimp_vector_tool_button_release):
	fixed condition which triggers the path tool's undo hack.  Fixes
	bug #138086. Also g_object_unref() the undo step.

	Removed trailing whitespace.

2004-03-25  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-shm.c: close the shm_open fd in the POSIX
	shm case. We were leaking an fd here.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_connect): remove
	unnecessary G_OBJECT() cast in g_object_set() call.

2004-03-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: be verbose about AUTOGEN_CONFIGURE_ARGS in the
	message that is printed if no arguments were passed.

2004-03-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
	    Michael Natterer <mitch@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.0.0 release.
