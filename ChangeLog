Sun Oct 26 22:28:15 EST 1997  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

        * added Spencer's patch to the brush and patterns dialog. Now
          instead of scrolling the object around to see all of, a small
	  window popups showing the entire brush or pattern.

        * added Spencers patch to add pop-up help to the toolbar.


Sun Oct 26 18:01:36 1997  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* configure: finished adding the xpm plug-in (someone else added
	  it to the makefiles, but forgot to ensure that its makefile was
	  built...)

	* app/about_dialog.c (about_dialog_create): About dialog now shows
	  "true" version (instead of 1.0) and randomizes the names in the
	  scrollbar instead of showing them in alphabetical order.

Sat Oct 25 14:53:27 1997  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: Eliminated use of
	  FLOATARRAYs in arguments due to shortcoming of argument passing
 	  protocol.

	* app/plug_in.c (plug_in_handle_proc_install): Added code to
	  sanitize plugins for compliance with the array passing
	  convention restriction.  Noncompliant plugins will be rejected.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: Fixed layers dialog resize bug - now
	  resizes interior of dialog instead of the close button. :)

Sat Oct 25 02:56:15 1997  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* Added auto-raise for most dialogs (if selected when already
	  "visible").  Also added a "Toolbox" menu entry to the Tools menu
	  that raises the Toolbox (no default binding cuz I can't think of
	  one).  Fixed the off-by-one-month timestamp bug.

Fri Oct 24 21:45:11 1997  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Made 0.99.15 release.

Fri Oct 24 17:54:54 EDT 1997 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* Applied a patch by Josh Parsons <josh@coombs.anu.edu.au>
          by way of Adam Moss to gif.c so that it works while
	  trying to save non-interactively. The comment string
          wasnt being handled well in non-interactive mode.

Fri Oct 24 11:49:55 1997  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

 	up several warnings in plug-ins.

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: #ifndef'ed out some variables according
	to Adam's MEMCPY_IS_NICE stuff so that the compiler emits no
	warnings about unused variables.

	* plug-ins/header.c: Raphael Quinet's patch to fix green channel
	and save reasonably-sized lines instead of a single enormous
	string.  Broken compilers barf on them.

	layers dialog if it is invoked when it was already shown.

	* app/commands.c (file_new_cmd_callback): Patch to not let the
	file/new dialog create indexed images.

	* app/tips_dialog.c (read_tips_file): Added fclose(fp).

	* app/gimprc.c (save_gimprc): Added g_free(cur_line).  It was
	missing and thus causing a memory leak.

	* README: Added reference to the plug-in registry.

Thu Oct 23 11:20:05 1997  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	(xcf_save_frac_compressed_tile): Fixed pointer printf args.

	* Fixed a *lot* of uninitialized variables in the app/ directory,
 	mainly in the pdb function invoker procedures.  This should
 	supress a trillion compiler warnings.

	* app/brush_select.c: removed brush_select_cancel_callback(); it
	was never being used.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_canvas_events): Changed the type
	of tmask to be GdkModifierType.

	* app/channels_dialog.c: Removed channel_widget_raise_callback()
	and channel_widget_lower_callback(); they were not being used.

	* app/brushes.c: Removed the declaration of int_value (it is never used).

	* app/gimprc.c app/gimprc.h app/commands.c app/tips_dialog.c:
 	save_gimprc() may modify the lists it gets passed (by
 	adding/removing elements).  Changed the prototype to take GList**
 	values instead of just GList*.  Changed the calls to save_gimprc()
	accordingly.

Thu Oct 23 01:46:28 CDT 1997 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

        * app/menus.c: applied patch malheiro-970917 which
          prevents installing bogus accelerator handlers for the
          menu separators.

        * All the rest of these are from Eiichi Takamori 
          <taka@ma1.seikyou.ne.jp>

        * plug-ins/gicon.c: fixed the number of return values on save

        * plug-ins/gicon.c: fixed the number of return values on save

          freed params in _gp_params_destroy()

        * libgimp/gimp.c: gimp_run_procedure() now frees proc_run.params,
          since it is allocated in that function and no longer used

        * app/plug_in.c: fixed memory overrun in plug_in.c when 
          nargs < current_return_nvals, in case the plug-in returns bad 
          number of return values.

        * app/plug_in.c: destroy arguments when PDB lookup failed.

        * app/plug_in.c: fixed memory leak in plug_in_params_destroy()
          and plug_in_args_destroy()

Wed Oct 22 20:38:46 EDT 1997  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	  and gimp-headers.scm)to the dist

	* also added a handful of scripts (predator.scm, circuit.scm, 
	  xach-effect.scm, copy-visible.scm, select_to_brush.scm, 
	  select_to_image.scm, and glow.scm). 
	  see www.gimp.org/~adrian/scripts.html

	* patched maze.c to work better interactively

        * patched noisify.c to show more informative labels and to 
          correct a bug with values of 0 for a channel still allowing
          some noise to be added.

        * changed some of the alien-glow-* scripts to have better defaults

        * moving script-fu wasnt entirely my idea :-)
  
Wed Oct 22 18:48:28 1997  Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* this was actually all Adrian's idea -- moved all the
          scripts from <Image>/Filters/Script-Fu to just 
          <Image>/Script-Fu

Fri Oct 17 15:59:58 1997  Christoph Hoegl  <darkwing@bsdd.regensburg.com>
