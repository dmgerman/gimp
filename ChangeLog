	* gimprc
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/tips_dialog.c: Moved the (last-tip-shown xx) entry to 
	sessionrc. You might want to delete that line from your gimprc, 
	but it works fine without doing so.

Tue Jun 23 23:21:16 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/menus.c: The lc-dialog can now be opened from the
	toolbox-menu. Did that in preparation for auto-opening dialogs on
	start-up.

Mon Jun 22 22:57:00 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* app/eraser.c:  Ack, try to get pressure sensitivity right this time.
	
Mon Jun 22 22:57:00 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* app/eraser.c:  Added support for pressure sensitive eraser
	
Mon Jun 22 23:35:52 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/pixmaps.h: Made a new pixmap for the ink tool that fits
	better to the others.

Mon Jun 22 18:43:22 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/app_procs.c

	* app/palette.c
	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.[ch]  (new files)
	* app/tools.c: Rough outline of session-managment. A new config
	file 'sessionrc' is written and the position of some windows is
	remembered. Still has some problems (offset by wm decorations).
	Can be switched off in the preferences.

Sun Jun 21 15:16:46 CDT 1998 Larry Ewing <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/devices.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/pixmaps.h
	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/undo.c: Lots of changes to the way tools are intialized and
	accessed.  All information about a tool type is now contained in a 
	single ToolInfo array.  There are still some small issues to
	adress about tool groups and we need some way of getting menu
	ordering/grouping to work better (plug-ins need this too).  There
	is still much to be done, but this is the next in cleaning up the
	tools.
	
	* app/posterize.[ch]
	* app/threshold.[ch]
	* app/histogram_tool.[ch]
	* app/hue_saturation.[ch]
	* app/levels.[ch]
	* app/brightness_contrast.[ch]
	* app/by_color_select.[ch]
	* app/color_balance.[ch]
	* app/curves.[ch]: Changed the *_initalize function prototypes from
	gpointer to GDisplay, to allow better type chacking and provide a 
	uniform interface for all the dialog tools.
		
Sun Jun 21 15:49:43 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/tools.c (tools_select): Set active_tool before
	updating device status dialog.

	* gimptool.in: fixes for new library versioning

Sat Jun 20 11:36:16 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am: really add thread support

Sat Jun 20 12:04:41 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile.h: #include config.h so we can tell if we're doing
	threads.  (GIMP's includes are f*ck*d.)

	* app/tile_cache.c app/tile.c app/tile.h app/tile_swap.c: modified
	tile swapping to preswap dirty tiles, using a thread if threads
	are enabled in configure or a gtk_timeout if they're not.  The
	code appears stable but could use improvement.  Be careful when
	working in here; there are four sets of semaphores and getting the
	locking wrong will cause deadlocks or tile corruption.  I'll try
	to write up a document describing what's going on in here sometime
	soon.

Fri Jun 19 16:37:40 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Thu Jun 18 23:11:36 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/ink.c: Shift the range to smaller brushes.

	* acconfig.h
	* config.h.in
	* configure.in: added --with-threads (taken from gtk+ configure.in)

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: ugly hack to force libgimpi.a to get
	rebuilt since libgimp.la compilations screws up the deps. Fixes
	relinking on make install.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: other cleanups

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug_in.c: pass INT32 instead of INT8 for gdisp_id since
	that's the correct type

	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c
	* plug-ins/tileit/tileit.c: warning fixups

Thu Jun 18 21:20:12 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	  gtk_container_[dis/en]able_resize()

Thu Jun 18 21:03:33 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	mode on the statusbar to prevent the window from being
	unnecessarily auto-shrunk.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c (my_gtk_label_set): Removed unused
	function using deprecated gtk_container_need_resize()
	
Thu Jun 18 16:31:16 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.c: Try to prevent overflows when drawing ellipses)
	(fixes the ink => line bug for big sizes)

	* channels_dialog.c
	* layers_dialog.c: the middle mouse button now pops up the menu
	as well as the third when clicking on the layer/channel. This should
	help users that use a tablet and don't have a right mouse button.

Wed Jun 17 17:47:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: fixed a bug I introduced with the 
	new mem_size_unit for the tile_cache_size

	* app/paint_funcs.c
	* app/paint_funcs.h: applied a patch from Jay Cox. 
	Reimplements selection_grow, selection_shrink, and selection_border 
	using new algorithms.

Wed Jun 17 12:07:44 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.c: default "save_window_positions_on_exit" to FALSE
	until I know why gdk_window_get_position() doesn't work properly
	when the window was never moved

Wed Jun 17 01:56:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: started to implement some sort of
	session-managment; right now it only saves a few window-positions.

	new ink tool functioning properly

	* app/tools.[ch]: added new and free funcs to the ToolInfo struct,
	and began small cleanup of tools

Mon Jun 15 12:42:43 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	tile_cache_size entry. Added spinbuttons where appropriate (used
	parts of the patch Nuke <nuke@bayside.net> sent to the list).	

Sun Jun 15 00:41:05 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: Table spacings

Sun Jun 14 23:41:17 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in.c: Fixed progress code to account for when
	a plugin gets two progress inits

	* app/interface.c: Fixed table allocation sickness.  Now use
	two tables, and a vbox instead of one table so things don't
	get expanded when they shouldn't.  This (table/table_inner)
	should be merged back to 1.0 tree.  The other resize bug is a 
	gtkstatusbar bug.

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/interface.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/plug_in.h
	* libgimp/gimp.c: added statusbar and progressbar, which
	the plugins now use if they have a gdisp.  Unfortunately 
	this introduces a resize bug I wasn't able to fix 
	immediately. ;-(

Sun Jun 14 18:37:06 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.[ch] (blob_bounds): Added new files for
	handling scan-converted convex polygons. (From
	gsumi) (these will be moved out to a plug-in tool directory
	when such a thing exists)

	* app/ink.[ch]: New tool for drawing with a hard-edged
	pressure and tilt-sensitive brush.

Sun Jun 14 16:03:29 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>
	
	* TODO: cleaned up and expanded the todo

	* libgimp/gimp.c: make the plugins aware of $gimpdir for gtkrc
	parsing

	now uses spinbuttons. I'm still not sure this change is
	for the better, let me know.

	*app/file_new_dialog.c
	app/file_new_dialog.h:
	app/gloal_edit.c:  added behaviour so that the
	new file size will default to the current cut buffer
	if its "fresh"

Thu Jun 11 23:37:06 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimp.m4: .m4 file for autoconf gimptool stuff

	* app/interface.c (create_toolbox): Create the color
	area before showing the window, so that the window gets
	created at the right size. [ This doesn't actually fix 
	much, but it is better to do that way ]

Wed Jun 10 14:17:44 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_origin_button_press): 
	Stop signal emission so that button doesn't grab the

	*app/file_new_dialog.c: more fiddling with file_new.

	them (from timj)

Mon Jun  8 17:16:22 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_select.[ch]: added a hex triplet to the color
	selector. It updates on focus_leave for now, so I bet there

	* app/buildmenu.c:

	big endian machines

Sun Jun  7 00:19:22 EDT 1998  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c: Reworked the file_new dialog to
	be a little more useful. Added entries for a height
	and width in the unit of your choice, and a resolution.
	Not everythings hooked up yet, but its getting there.

Sun Jun  7 00:22:01 EDT 1998  Matthew Wilson  <msw@gimp.org>

	  app/paintbrush.c app/palette.c app/scroll.c
	  app/tools.[ch] app/undo.c

	- Added two new dialogs - input devices; (GtkInputDialog)
	  and DeviceStatus - which shows the tool/color for
	  each device.

	- Added device_status_update() call that gets called
	  whenever the tool/color etc. are changed.

	- Added ~/.gimp/devicerc file to store settings

	- Code to draw cursor on canvas for non XFree86 XInput
	  where device can't control cursor and extended input
	  device simultaneously.

	- Changed input handling so that we always use the pointer
	  position from the device, not from gdk_input_window_get_cursor,
	  so that motion and cursor position sync.

	- Various changes so things work with non-integer coordinates

	- Pay attention to pressure and tilt in basic tool support.

        - New paint mode PRESSURE that changes the brush based on
	  the brush pressure

	- Left in a few XInput hacks that should be removed, but I no longer
	  remember what they are.
