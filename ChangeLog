	* app/plug-in/gimppluginprocframe.c: keep a reference to the
	proc_frame's procedure. We can't asume it's always there since it
	could be a temporary one and its plug-in might die during
	procedure execution, taking the temp_proc with it.

	Bug 553534 â€“ centering issues after image scaling and setting zoom
	to 100%

	* app/display/display-enums.h: Added a GimpZoomFocus enum with
	'best guess', 'pointer' or 'image center' values.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.[ch]
	(gimp_display_shell_scale): Take a GimpZoomFocus parameter and
	pass it on to

	(gimp_display_shell_scale_get_zoom_focus): which returns the
	requested zoom focus point if one was given, else makes a best
	guess.

	* app/actions/view-commands.c
	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c
	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale-dialog.c: For explicit-zoom
	commands like "zoom to 100%", always use the image center as the
	zoom focus point. For all other zooming, continue to use the
	best-guess method.

	* app/display/display-enums.c: Regenerated.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimptool.c: create the target directory and intermediate
	parent directories as needed. Restores the behavior of the
	gimptool shell script.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am (%.xml): added a dependency on configure.in to
	make sure that the image-menu.xml file is rebuilt when the version
	number is changed.

2008-10-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* app/plug-in/gimpplugin.c
	* app/widgets/gtkscalebutton.c: : Don't #define _GNU_SOURCE on
	Windows as it confuses newest mingw headers.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.6.1 (interface age 1).

2008-09-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
