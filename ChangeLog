	* plug-ins/plugin-helper/plugin-helper.c
	extensions don't have parameters,
	but helper_run() was asking anyway -
	and segfaulting. Commented out
	line for now; everything still seems
	prototypical in Plug In Helper Land.
	
2001-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimplayer.[ch]: added a "linked_changed" signal and emit it
	in gimp_layer_set_linked().

	* app/gui/layers-dialog.c: use the accessor when setting "linked".

	* app/widgets/gimpdrawablelistitem.[ch]: made the hacks which make
	the buttons look nice inside list items available to subclasses.

	* app/widgets/gimplayerlistitem.[ch]: added a "linked" button.

2001-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerview.[ch]: added virtual method
	context_item() which works like select_item() and activate_item()
	and a function to trigger the signal from subclasses (marked as
	"protected").

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerlistview.c: invoke context_item() on
	right click.

	* app/widgets/gimpdrawablelistview.[ch]: implement context_item()
	and show a context menu. The functions to show the menu as well as
	functions to create a new drawable and to edit it's attriutes must
	be passed to the constructor now.

	* app/gui/channels-commands.[ch]
	* app/gui/layers-commands.[ch]: added functions which show the
	layers and channels context menus. No accelerators supported yet.
	Auto-destroy all dialogs when their drawable is removed from the
	image.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c: changed the calls to
	gimp_drawable_list_view_new() accordingly.

	* app/gui/menus.c
	* app/gui/test-commands.[ch]: removed some test dialogs.

2001-04-28  David Neary  <dneary@eircom.net>

	* app/tools/transform_options.[ch]: Separated the transform
	options stuff from the gimptransformtool files so that each of the
	transform tools to make is available to the other transform tools.

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c
	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.c
	* app/tools/gimprotatetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.c
	* app/tools/Makefile.am: Changed accordingly
	
2001-04-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/appenums.h: added RunModeType.
	* app/plug_in.h: removed RunModeType.
	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: don't scan app/plug_in.h for enums.
	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: regenerated.

	* app/file-open.[ch]
	* app/file-save.[ch]
	* app/file-utils.[ch]: removed all GUI specific code.

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/file-dialog-utils.[ch]
	* app/gui/file-open-dialog.[ch]
	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.[ch]: new files.
	Renamed file_open() to 	file_open_with_display().

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/docindex.c
	* app/gimpdnd.c
	* app/gui/commands.c
	* app/gui/gui.c
	* app/gui/menus.c: changed accordingly.

2001-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.[ch]: removed stuff which now lives in gui/gui.c,
	removed global variable "we_are_exiting", made app_init() static.

	* app/appenv.h: removed "we_are_exiting".

	* app/colormaps.c: don't #include "app_procs.h"

	* app/file-open.[ch]
	* app/file-save.[ch]: removed the *_pre_init() functions and
	renamed the *_post_init() functions to *_menu_init().

	* app/gui/gui.c: added more GUI init and shutdown code from
	app_procs.c

2001-04-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainermenuimpl.c: only work around option
	menu reference problems if the removed item was the active one.

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.c: don't try to avoid a recursive
	signal emission in gimp_image_dock_image_changed() but work around
	it. This makes the image menu work finally.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c: removed debugging output.

2001-04-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpobject.c: free the object's name on destruction.

	* app/gimpparasite.c: gimp_personal_rc_file()'s return value has
	to be g_free()'d.

	* app/main.c: indentation.

	Ported memleak fixes from 1.2:

	* app/gimpbrush.c: don't leak all pixmaps.

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: free all the pipe's brushes here.

2001-04-24  David Neary  <dneary@eircom.net>

	* app/authors.h: Synced this file from the earlier commit.

	* app/pixmaps2.h
	* app/pdb/tools_cmds.c
	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.h

	* app/tools/gimptool.h
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c
	* app/tools/tools.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb:    Enabled the rest of the 
	transform tools and changed some of the options stuff in 
	transform_options_new(). There are one or two outstanding 
	(non-critical) runtime problems in that function.

2001-04-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/authors.h: regenerated.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c: call the drawable views's
	set_context() function once explicitly after creation.

	* app/gui/dialogs.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: session management correctly
	remembers the dialogs' sizes again.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainermenuimpl.c: set the options menu's
	history to "0" after removing a menu item (temp hack because
	GtkOptionMenu doesn't handle the removal of the currently active
	item correctly).

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.c: another try to get dock->context's
	signals handled correctly. Debugging output will disappear soon.

2001-04-23  David Neary  <dneary@eircom.net>

        * AUTHORS: Added my name here before being politely
        informed that the file is autogenerated. Ooops!

        * tools/authorsgen/contributors: Added my name to the
        list of contributors.

2001-04-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: some minor fixes / cleanup.

	* app/gimpdata.c: forgot to gtk_object_class_add_signals() in
	class_init().

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: added a tool_tab_func() so
	the notebook tab shows a tool preview, pass a GimpContext to all
	dialog constructors and added set_context() functions for all
	dockable based dialogs so they can be configured to use the
	context of the destination dock when dragging them around.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainermenuimpl.c: removed debugging output.

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: add a method to create
	dockables (which gets passed the dock the dockable will be added
	to) so the dockables can be created in the right context.

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.[ch]: added a GimpContext attribute, remove
	the dockbooks explicitely in destroy().

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.[ch]: dockables now know about their
	set_context_func() and can thus be dragged between different
	contexts.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.c: gimp_dockbook_add(): refuse to add
	dockables to dockbooks which are not part of a dock, set the
	dockable's context after adding it.

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.[ch]: image docks now keep a pointer
	to the global image list which is passed to them on construction
	so they don't need to know about the global "image_context"
	variable, added an "Auto" button like in L&C.

	* app/gui/dialogs-commands.c: changed accordingly.

2001-04-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged Yosh's changes from stable branch:

	* acinclude.m4: updated libtool stuff

        * configure.in: more #undefs so jpeglib.h test works

        * plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c: speedup patch from Ernst Lippe
        <ernstl@planet.nl> (tile cache size optimization)

2001-04-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged changes from stable branch:
	
        * plug-ins/perl/examples/terral_text: fixed typo.

        * plug-ins/perl/examples/image_tile
        * plug-ins/perl/examples/yinyang: 
        applied gimp-kirchgessner-010422-0.patch which fixes problems with 
        invalid number of parameters passed to some functions.

        * plug-ins/script-fu/interp_sliba.c: fixed problems with strbreakup 
        reported by Mike Kelly <mike@csuchico.edu> (bugs #52383 and #52385)

2001-04-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am: cleanup.

	* app/interface.c: #include "gimpui.h"

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]
	* app/gui/dialogs.c
	* app/gui/menus.c
	* app/gui/test-commands.[ch]: changes for the image menu below.

	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainermenu.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainermenuimpl.[ch]: new widgets. The actual
	implemtation lives in a separate file because
	gimpcontainermenu.c's code is identical to gimpcontainerview.c's
	except for the base class. This will become an interface with Gtk 2.0.

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.[ch]: a dock with an image menu. The
	pages still don't follow the context correctly.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenuitem.[ch]: a menu item with a preview.

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: pass a dock constructor to
	the constructor and provide a method to create a new dock within
	this factory's context.

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.[ch]: removed the constructor because we
	create only image docks now. Put the vbox into a main_vbox (which
	also contains the image menu).

	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.[ch]: create new docks with the dialog
	factory.

	* app/gimpcontainer.[ch]
	* app/gimpdata.[ch]

2001-04-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/lc_dialogP.h
	* app/paths_dialogP.h: removed stuff that will go away anyway (put
	the declarations to the public headers).

	* app/gimpui.[ch]: new function gimp_widget_get_callback_context()
	which may only be called from a *_cmd_callback() and returns the
	data we attached with weird methods.

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/channels-commands.[ch]: callbacks independent from the
	channels dialog and the "new" and "edit channel" dialogs.

	* app/gui/channels-dialog.[ch]
	* app/gui/layers-commands.c
	* app/gui/layers-dialog.[ch]

	* app/gui/paths-dialog.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpbezierselecttool.c
	* po/POTFILES.in: changed accordingly.

2001-04-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpui.[ch]: new functions gimp_window_add_accel_group() and
	gimp_window_remove_accel_group() which do the ugly accel context
	hack described below.

	* app/interface.c
	* app/gui/layers-dialog.c: use the new functions.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gui/layers-commands.c: removed stuff which is now done
	automatically.

2001-04-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/layers_dialogP.h: removed.

	* app/gimpui.[ch]: new function gimp_menu_position().

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/gui/layers-dialog.c: popup the image and layers menu with
	gtk_item_factory_popup_with_data() instead of gtk_menu_popup()
	and pass the GimpImage we're operating on as data.

	For accelerators, which are invoked without context, we catch key
	press events and attach the context to the GtkItemFactory.

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/layers-commands.[ch]: common layer callbacks (instead of
	separate ones in commands.c and layers-dialog.c

	* app/gui/commands.[ch]
	* app/gui/layers-dialog.[ch]: removed the menu callbacks here.

	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/lc_dialog.c
	* app/gui/channels-dialog.c
	* app/gui/layer-select.c
	* app/gui/menus.c
	* po/POTFILES.in: changed accordingly.

2001-04-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c: set the message handler for all app log domains, not
	only for "Gimp".

	* app/gui/brush-select.c
	* app/gui/gradient-select.c
	* app/gui/palette-select.c: removed the "edit" callbacks.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: Added the callbacks
	here. Added layer and channel lists.

	* app/gui/dialogs.c: register the new lists.
	* app/gui/menus.c: their menu entries.

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c: set a minimal width of 280 pixels.

2001-04-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am

	<dneary@eircom.net> which brings clone and convolve back.

	That's all paint tools, Dudes!

	* app/gimpdrawable-desaturate.[ch]
	* app/gimpdrawable-equalize.[ch]
	* app/gimpdrawable-invert.[ch]: new files.

	* app/gui/commands.c: put some stuff from desaturate, equalize and
	invert here. While it's ok to check the drawable type in the
	callback, this is the wrong place for PDB wrappers.

	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c

	* app/gui/brush-select.c

	"singleton" and "session_managed" flags say.

2001-04-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/session.[ch]
	* app/gimprc.c: removed the old dialog session management code...

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: ...and manage all dialogs here.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: dialog factory compliant
	constructors for all session managed toplevel dialogs.

	to return the dialog now (even the legacy ones that will go away).
	Removed the session management code as this is now done for the
	dialogs, not by them.

	* app/app_procs.c

2001-04-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	First attempt to get the docks session managed:

	* app/gimprc.c: new gimprc type "new-session-info" which will soon
	replace the original one.

	* app/menus.c
	* app/gui/dialogs.c: s/_/-/g in all dialog identifier strings.

	* app/session.[ch]: call the dialog factory's session functions.

	* app/test_commands.c: use the dialog factory to create the tabs.

	* app/gui/dialogs-commands.c
	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: the constructors return widgets,
	not dockables now.

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: maintain a list of dialog
	factories in the class struct. Added ugly code to do the GimpDock
	session management.

	* app/gui/gui.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c: changed accordingly.

2001-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/Makefile.am: new files:

	* app/gui/gui.[ch]: the new place for the UI init and shutdown code.
	* app/gui/splash.[ch]: a separate file for the splash.

	* app/app_procs.c: removed lots of stuff. Still much UI code left.

2001-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.[ch]: changed all menus_get_*() functions to return
	the GtkItemFactory, not separate widget, and accel_group
	pointers. Disabled automatic tearoff item creation for all
	factories axcept the toolbox and image factory.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/file-open.c
	* app/file-save.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/toolbox.c: changed accordingly.

2001-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/paletteP.h: removed

	* app/palette.[ch]
	* app/palette_select.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/Makefile.am: some more preparation for file moving.

2001-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am: grouped the files together which will go to gui/.

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: maintain a list of open
	GimpDocks for session management.

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c: register open docks with the dialog
	factory.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.c: pass a pointer to the GimpDockbook
	to the GimpDockable's "get_tab" function because the function is
	called before the dockable is added to the dockbook.

	* app/test_commands.c
	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]
	* app/gui/dialogs.c: changed accordingly.

2001-04-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: added some more dialog types.

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: removed again...

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: ...and added where it belongs.

	* app/gui/dialogs.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c: changed #include's

	* app/gui/dialogs-commands.c: dialogs can be removed via the menu
	now.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.c: ref the dockbook while the item
	factory is active because an item factory callback may destroy it
	(we need to add the hijacked GtkNotebook menu back to the
	notebook).

2001-04-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/Makefile.am: new directory which will contain all gui code
	except widgets (I was tired off adding new files to app/).

	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gui/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: factory which produces dialogs
	from string descriptions. Should maybe go to widgets/.

	* app/gui/dialogs-commands.[ch]: callbacks for the new menu
	factory below.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: dialog constructors which are
	registered with the dialog factory.

	* app/gui/dialogs.[ch]: register the dialogs with the factory.

	* app/app_procs.c: call dialogs_register().

	* app/menus.[ch]: a new item factory for creating dialogs.

	* app/test_commands.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdock.[ch]: added a dialog factory pointer to the
	GimpDock struct.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.[ch]: badly (badly!) fiddle around with
	GtkNotebook's menu to get it integrated in the GtkItemFactory
	which produces new dialogs.

2001-04-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.[ch]: removed the ID system from the pdb/
	subdir...

	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: ...and temporarily added it back to GimpImage.

	The ID stuff is not only used by the PDB but is a more general
	type of service which is needed for the PDB, DND and some parts of
	the GUI. Finally, a GimpFactory class with subclasses for data
	objects, images etc. will maintain the ID spaces.

2001-04-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdnd.c: added a DND type for GimpImage.

	* app/tools/tools.c: don't register bezier select twice.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.[ch]: hacked the popup menu a bit.

2001-04-11  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz> 

        On request of Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>: 
        * plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c:
        GIMP couldn't read bmp files with a ba chunk. This kind of files
        can be found in OS/2 1.x.

	from Dave Neary <dave.neary@palamon.ie> which reactivates the
	smudge tool.

2001-04-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/test_commands.c: fixed the dockable names.

	* app/tools/gimpbezierselecttool.c: applied patch from Dave Neary
	which fixes some minor stuff that was forgotten to port.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.c: set the tooltip of the notebook tab
	also if it is a plain label.

2001-04-11  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimppathtool.[ch]

	new files:
	* app/tools/gimppathtool.c
	* app/tools/gimppathtool.h

	Reactivated (at least partially) the old new path tool. It
	will undergo major restructuring. Especially the path stuff 
	will become proper objects. This definitely is work in progress
	and totally unuseable now.

2001-04-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/paint-funcs/.cvsignore
	* app/paint-funcs/Makefile.am: made the paint-funcs directory compile

	* app/gimpdockable.[ch]: new widgets (not used yet).

	* app/menus.c

	minor fixes in all files.

2001-04-06  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz> 

        On request of Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>:
        * plugins/common/tga.c: Fixed bug #52728 - problem in loading
        compressed and uncompressed 15 bit tga, compressed 16 bit tga
        files and removed a false warning for 32 bit tga files.

2001-04-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/arch/i386/mmx/paint_funcs_mmx.S.m4: split MMX detection out
	of paint_funcs_mmx.S and replaced it with a working version (the 
	old one used to execute an illegal instruction on non-MMX systems).

2001-04-01  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* nearly all files:
	
	Changed all GUI-Stuff back to Motif (see www.openmotif.org).
	Finally we have a professional toolkit here. When you need some
	reasons, why GTK+ sucks: See
	      http://unix.oreilly.com/news/motif_0400.html

2001-04-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.c
	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: changed accordingly. Removed many
	"reset" callbacks which just redirected the call to
	paint_options_reset() or selection_options_reset().

2001-03-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/undo.c: made undo_pop_paint() work again.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimpfliptool.[ch]: applied a patch from Dave Neary
	which re-activates this tool. Enabled the tool options too.

	* app/tools/gimpbezierselecttool.c
	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilltool.c
	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c
	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c: trivial fixes.

	* app/tools/gimptool.c: removed cruft.

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: a special case for the flip
	tool, cleanup.

	* app/tools/tools.c: register the flip tool.

	* app/tools/gimpdodgeburntool.[ch]: made cursor toggling work
	again, cleanup.

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimptool.c: minor cleanups like removing STUB()s.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: applied patch from Dave Neary which
	returns useful PDB strings for the paint tools again.

2001-03-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/undo.c: re-enabled transform undo. Fixes the transform tool
	crashes.

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]: put tool->ID back because the undo
	system uses it. Also, a unique tool serial number will be not too
	bad to have once we have module tools.

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: changed accordingly.

2001-03-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am

	tool.

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.[ch]: minor cleanups, declare
	gimp_scale_tool_register() publically.

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: removed the PixelSurround stuff,
	hardcode tr_tool->interactive to TRUE, removed the no_draw() function,
	register the tool options, misc. other fixes and bad hacks that need
	to go away.

	(All this non-interactive stuff needs to be done outside the tool
	system. A "non-interactive tool" is just pure nonsense)

	* app/tools/gimptool.h: spacing.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: tool_manager_register_tool_options():
	return after warning, don't simply continue and crash.

	* app/tools/tools.c: register the bezier select tool.

2001-03-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/fileopsP.h: removed...

	* app/file-open.[ch]

	* po/POTFILES.in
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: changed accordingly (mostly changing

2001-03-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.[ch]: some random cleanups in pre-historic code.

	* app/fileops.c: useless cleanup (will be split into file-open.[ch]
	and file-save.[ch] soon).

	* app/gimppattern.c: implement GimpData's "duplicate" method.

	* app/global_edit.c: cleanup in preparation for making a view on a
	GimpContainer of cut buffers out of it.

	* app/gradient_editor.c: don't let the name entry expand vertically.

	* app/menus.c: typos.

2001-03-25 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

        * app/tools/gimpbezierselecttool.[ch]: added new files from
	Dave Neary <dneary@eircom.net> to give back bezier curves.  This

	* app/tools/paint_options.c : applied 1-line patch by Dave Neary
	<dneary@eircom.net> that takes away the warning on startup of 
	dodgeburn.

2001-03-25 18:16:50  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: Define accessor function/macro for histogram
	reads and writes.  This slows us down a little because we avoid
	some of the dirty tricks we used when we knew that the histogram
	was a straight 3d array, so I've recovered some of the speed loss
	by implementing a 5d accessor function with good locality of
	reference.  This change is the first step towards quantizing in a
	more interesting colourspace than frumpy old RGB.

2001-03-24  Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.[ch]: Made the scale tool work again.
	Doesn't draw on the screen correctly, but works if you set the
	size in the dialog box.  Fixing the path tool should solve the
	problem.  Don't you love wierd dependancies?
	
	* app/tools/gimptool.c: stubbed some more path tool functions.
	
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: fixed some serious problems.
	I can't believe Gimp linked before!

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/tools.c 
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: changed accordingly

	* po-script-fu/ro.po
	* po-libgimp/ro.po
	* plug-ins/perl/po/ro.po
	* plug-ins/perl/po/tr.po : added empty translation files so it would

	language, even if they're blank!

2001-03-23  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimpdodgeburntool.[ch]: dodgeburn works again.  Non-GUI

	still.

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c
	* app/tools/paint_options.c

2001-03-23  Marius Andreiana  <mandreiana@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added ro (Romanian) to ALL_LINGUAS

2001-03-22  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>  

        * app/tools/gimpbucketfilltool.c: Bucket fill threshold=0 must
        be allowed.

2001-03-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: guard inclusion of <process.h> by G_OS_WIN32
	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl: add include <string.h> if the generated code
	used memcpy().
	
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: include process.h for G_OS_WIN32.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: regenerated

2001-03-16  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gqbist.c : #define PATH_MAX as _MAX_PATH
	if it isn't defined

	* plug-ins/common/gz.c : #include <io.h> for win32 _get_osfhandle ()

	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c : #include <gtk/gtk.h> before using
	G_OS_WIN32

	* plug-ins/twain/twain.c : provide a main () entry point to allow
	to build as console application as well

2001-03-16  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* app/makefile.msc
	* app/tools/makefile.msc : adapted to current state of file 
	renaming/restructuring. Probably will break again soon ...

	* app/context_manager.c : needs register_tools () prototype

	* app/gimplist.c
	* app/gimppalette-import.c : #include <string.h> for memcpy, strcmp 
	and friends

	* app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c : #include <process.h>	/* for _getpid() */
	(Yes I know that this is not the right place to change it, but hacking 
	pdbgen.pl to get platform specific headers is out of my scope)

	* app/test_commands.c : explicit casts to (GimpSetDrawableFunc) make
	it compile even with strict checks turned on.

	* app/undo.c (undo_pop_paint) : return a value even if the function 
	does nothing at the moment (makes it compile)

	* libgimp/gimp.def : updated

	* libgimp/gimpcolorselector.h : include <gmodule.h> to make 
	gimp_color_selector_(un)register prototypes conform to their
	implementation

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h : reflect 1.3 version

	* libgimpmath/gimpmatrix.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpdialog.c : more <string.h> inclusion

	* libgimp/makefile.msc : moved gimpadativesupersample.c to 
	libgimpcolor, which makes it reusable from the core, too.

	* libgimp/gimp.def : updated

	* libgimp/gimpproceduraledb.c : #include <string.h>

	* libgimpcolor/gimpcolor.def
	* libgimpcolor/makefile.msc : added gimpadaptivesupersample

	* libgimpmath/gimpmatrix.c : #include <string.h> for memcmp
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpdialog.c - " - for strcmp


2001-03-15 14:51:59Z  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* gimptool-1.4.in: Fix --libs-noui so that plug-ins link against
        the new library names.
        * configure.in: Added the libtool-limitation-workaround to GIMP_LIBS*
        env vars so that gimp-perl works again.

2001-03-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c: applied patch from 
        Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp> which fixes wrong array size.

2001-03-14  Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: merged in all the old transform
        tool code.

        * tools/gimptool.h: added dummy GtkTypes for all the transform tools.

2001-03-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* configure.in: Added "tr" into ALL_LINGUAS..

2001-03-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/wilber.xpm: Fixed one pixel.

2001-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimplayerlistview.c: added some help_data and tooltips.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimperasertool.[ch]: one more.

	* app/tools/gimppaintbrushtool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimppenciltool.[ch]: made all paint tools look the same.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c
	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/paint_options.c
	* app/tools/tools.c: changed accordingly.

	* pixmaps/anchor.xpm: made it a bit smaller.

	* pixmaps/refresh.xpm: replaced with the "Recurrence" icon from
	evolution.

2001-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am
	* pixmaps/edit.xpm: new pixmap. "Someone" needs to go over the
	pixmaps one day ;)

	* app/gimpdatafactoryview.c
	* app/gimpdrawablelistview.c: use the new icon.

	* app/floating_sel.c: stupid: the new gimp_layer_get_opacity()
	accessor speaks in normalized [0.0..1.0] values, so the
	floating selection was invisible after blindly using it.

	* app/gimpimage.c: more stupid: a totally useless sanity clamping
	made the composite preview ugly. Fixed.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: why the heck did this never crash before:
	don't dereference a NULL GDisplay pointer.

2001-03-11  Seth Burgess      <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimppenciltool.[ch]: no. 16 for your

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/selection_options.c
	* app/tools/tools.c: changed accordingly.

2001-03-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimplayerlistview.c: minor cleanups.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimpblendtool.[ch]: back again.

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/paint_options.c
	* app/tools/tools.c: changed accordingly.

2001-03-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimplayerlistview.[ch]: new subclass of GimpDrawableListView
	(the upcoming replacement of the layers dialog). Connects to the
	new GimpLayer signals using the layer container as signal proxy
	(see below).

	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]: made "set_container" a virtual
	function.  This is needed by the GimpLayerListView to
	connect/disconnect signals. Subclasses implementing this method
	MUST obey the following order of instructions:

	1. disconnect from signals related to GimpContainerView->container
	2. chain up (!!!)
	3. connect to signals related to GimpContainerView->container

	And yes, I will add DocBook files for all those new objects :)

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: made "border_color" a GimpRGB instead of
	guchar[3]. Added gimp_preview_set_border_color().

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimplayerlistitem.c: use gimp_preview_set_border_color().

	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpdrawablelistview.c: cleanup.

	* app/gimpdrawablelistitem.c: we can safely asume that our parent
	widget is a GimpDrawableListView and use it's "reorder_drawable"
	function pointer (after checking that it's there).

	* app/gimplistitem.c: connect the correct DND type when changing
	the container of a list item with "reorderable" enabled.

	* app/gimplayer.[ch]: added accessors and "*_changed" signals for
	layer->mode, layer->opacity and layer->preserve_trans.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: fixed a FIXME: use the correct bucket fill
	tool context again.

	* app/tools/paint_options.[ch]: paint_mode_menu_new(): added a
	boolean which toggles the "Behind" item on/off to the same
	constructor can be used for all paint mode menus.

	* app/tools/gimptoolinfo.c: rect. select is the standard tool again.

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/floating_sel.c
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: use the new layer accessors and the
	paint_mode_menu constructor.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/undo.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c
	* app/tools/gimptool.c
	* app/tools/paint_options.c
	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: put the #warning's back inside
	#ifdef __GNUC__

2001-03-10  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c: Applied patch from
	Austin Donnelly to fix rendering of the topmost

2001-03-10  Garry R. Osgood <grosgood@rcn.com>
	
	* app/Makefile.am
	Inclusion of David's MMX code into Makefile now 
	depends on prior definition of HAVE_ASM_MMX.
	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c
	Line 276 cast of va_args to type GimpRGB seems
	very problematical on SGI, as the va_args macro
	expands to Extreme Ugliness and 
	(GimpRGB)(Extreme Ugliness) does not compile.
	RH Linux seems indifferent and accepts either.

2001-03-11  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c: Enhance to also be able to paste
	BI_BITFIELDS images, 16- or 32-bit. Global indentation and spacing
	fix (use cvs diff -bu2 to see the real differences).

2001-03-09  Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: it compiles, but probably isn't 
	useful

	* app/tools/Makefile.am: changed accordingly

2001-03-09  Zach Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* TODO.xml: Added "Open into layer" entry.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/tools/selection_options.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.c: cleanup.

2001-03-09  Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

	Still does not compile, but it's much closer.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am

	* app/mit.[ch]: Increased Mitch's age by one. Hopefully
	this won't break everything.

>>>>>>> 1.3409
2001-03-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage.[ch]: removed the layer mask functions.

	* app/gimpchannel.[ch]: added a boolean "dummy" parameter to
	gimp_channel_copy() so it has the same signature as
	gimp_layer_copy() and can be used by the GimpDrawableListView to
	generically duplicate drawables.

	* app/gimpcontainerview.c: call "select_item" with a NULL item
	before changing the underlying GimpContainer so subclasses have
	a chance to update (e.g. set button sensitivity).

	* app/gimpdnd.c: folded all the GtkType comparing code into a
	utility function (much more readable now).

	* app/gimpdrawablelistview.[ch]: activated the "raise", "lower",
	"duplicate" and "delete" buttons. I'm not really happy with all
	those function pointers passed to the constructor (and the dummy
	parameters I've added to some GimpChannel functions) -- OTOH the
	generic view maybe worth the "gboolean dummy" cruft hanging around
	in the channel class.

	* app/gimplayer.[ch]: removed the "apply_mask", "edit_mask" and
	"show_mask" booleans ...

	* app/gimplayermask.[ch]: .. and added them here together with
	proper accessors and "*_changed" signals.

	This also makes the layer mask undo code much clearer as we don't
	have to store the booleans separately.

	* app/gimplayerlistitem.c: badly hacked to acheive the correct
	indicator being drawn around the active drawable. This needs
	a new GimpPreview function for setting the border color.

	* app/gimplistitem.c: smaller horizontal spacing.

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: added the "border_width" parameter also to
	gimp_preview_set_size() so we can modify all previews the same way
	after creation.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: no need to push an undo group around
	the "duplicate layer" code. Was this an artefact or did I miss
	something here ???

	* app/channel_ops.c
	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpdrawablelistitem.c

	* app/pdb/channel_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/channel.pdb
	* app/pdb/selection_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/selection.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimplayer_pdb.[ch]
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: commented out the layer mask accessors
	from the perl code, so the functions temporarily disappeared all
	over the place.

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: don't build XJT until the layer mask stuff
	is back.

	* pixmaps/eye.xpm: cropped it to it's minimal size.

>>>>>>> 1.3407
2001-03-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimpimage-undo.[ch]
	* app/gimpundo.[ch]
	* app/gimpundostack.[ch]: added new GimpUndo and GimpUndoStack objects 
	which will be used for the upcoming new undo system. Actually my 
	current plan for the undo system is to keep it pretty much as it is...
	
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: added new GimpUndoStacks but temporarily kept
	old GSLists around, so I don't break everything now.

>>>>>>> 1.3406
2001-03-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimpgradientpreview.c
	* app/gimppalettepreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c
	* app/gimptoolinfopreview.c: removed all dnd code ...

	* app/gimppreview.c: ... and put it where is belongs.

	* app/gimpcontext.c: use g_type_is_a() instead of comparing the
	types directly.

	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: same g_type_is_a() fix here. New function
	gimp_dnd_viewable_source_unset().

	* app/gimpdrawablelistitem.c: gtk_signal_connect_while_alive() to
	GimpDrawable's "visibility_changed" fixes a crash here.

	* app/gimplayerlistitem.c: check more strictly if DND reordering
	of layers is allowed.

	* app/gimplistitem.c: more DND reordering checking.
	Start drawing the drop indicator at x = name_label->allocation.x
	(looks better IMHO).

2001-03-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimplayerlistitem.[ch]: new widget derived from
	GimpDrawableListItem (additionally displays the layer mask),

	* app/gimplistitem.[ch]: added the preview_size to the struct so
	subclasses can create previews at arbitrary times. Removed the
	"preview_size" parameter from "set_viewable".

	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: removed the layer mask functions because
	they belong to GimpLayer.

	* app/gimplayer.[ch]: folded the layer mask code from GimpImage
	into GimpLayer's layer mask functions. Added a "mask_changed"
	signal which is emitted when a mask is added/removed. Added
	"push_undo" parameters to the functions so we can use them from
	the undo system.

	* app/undo.c: instead of badly poking the GimpLayer struct, use
	the accessors with push_undo = FALSE.

	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/gimpdrawablelistitem.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c

	* app/gimpdrawable.[ch]: new function gimp_drawable_set_visible().
	Renamed gimp_drawable_visible() to gimp_drawable_get_visible().
	Added a "visibility_changed" signal.

	* app/gimplistitem.[ch]: new virtual function "set_viewable"
	which allows subclasses to connect to the viewable's signals.

	* app/gimpdrawablelistitem.[ch]: added an eye button. Implement
	"set_viewable" to connect to the "visibility_changed" signal.

	* app/gimpchannel.[ch]: removed unused function
	gimp_channel_toggle_visibility().

	* app/channels_dialog.c

	code generation nicer.

	* pixmaps/eye.xpm: cropped it a bit.

2001-03-04  Zbigniew Chyla  <cyba@gnome.pl>

2001-03-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c (prefs_save_callback): applied a patch

	* app/Makefile.am

	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: new function gimp_dnd_get_drag_data(widget)
	which returns a GimpViewable using the widget's drag callback.

	* app/gimpdrawablelistview.c: implement GimpContainerView's
	"insert_item" method and enable reordering for the created
	GimpListItem.

2001-03-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/appenums.h: renamed ZoomType to GimpZoomZype and added it
	here.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/nav_window.c
	* app/scale.[ch]: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/magnify.[ch]: back as object.

	* app/tools/tool.c: removed the old ToolInfo entry.

	* app/tools/tools.c: register it.

2001-03-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimpselectiontool.[ch]: new files ported by
	Dave Neary <dneary@eircom.net>. Changed them a bit to inherit
	from GimpDrawTool and added implementations of "modifier_key"
	and "oper_update" because they are shared by 4 of the old
	selection tools.

2001-03-01  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* app/fileops.c: Applied patch from Dave Neary to fix
	bug 37633 "File->Revert doesn't resize canvas".

2001-03-01  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

        * plugins/common/despeckle.c: Fixed black_level range.
        Valid range should be -1..255, not 0..256, because comaparison
        is > and <=. Bug became visible after last Martin Weber's fix.
        There must be for both black and white levels one extra value
        to cover all numbers 0..255.

2001-03-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/crop.[ch]: we need to override GimpDrawTool's "draw"
	method to actually see something.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: fixed the crash introduced by the migration
	of gimage->layers and gimage->channels to GimpContainer.

2001-02-20  Nathan Summers  <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.h: Started work on the TransformCore.  
	Very incomplete.  Needs a friendly visit from genmarshal.pl.  Not yet 
	included in the build.  Move along now, folks, there's nothing more to
	see.

2001-02-28  Nathan Summers  <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/crop.c
	* app/tools/crop.h: Fixed a couple instances where the crop tool was
	incorrectly inheriting from GimpTool instead of GimpDrawTool.  The crop 
	tool still does not work completely correctly on my machine.  It does
	not show the lines and sometimes it includes garbage.

2001-02-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Please, do not change the files in app/pdb directly, they are
	autogenerated. And, please, whatever you change, type make in
	the toplevel srcdir, since pdbgen might decide it has to change 
	some more files because of your changes.
	
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/tools_cmds.c
	* app/tools/crop.c
	* libgimp/gimpenums.h
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-constants.c
	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: made everything compile again

2001-02-27  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* app/appenums.h
	* app/gimplayer.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: When adding a layer mask allow the option
	of using the current selection (or it's inverse) to initialise
	the mask.

2001-02-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimage.c. #include "tools/tool.h"

	* app/tools/edit_selection.[ch]: the arrow_key function is not
	a method of edit_selection but of any tool that needs it.

	* app/tools/gimppaintbrushtool.c: removed variables.

	* app/tools/move.c: use the arrow_key function.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.h: removed the include of "tool.h"

2001-02-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/edit_selection.[ch]: back as real tool which gets
	temporarily pushed to the tool_manager's new tool stack.

	* app/tools/move.c
	* app/tools/text_tool.c: call the edit_selection stuff again.

	* app/tools/tool.c: added a STUB().

	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]: implemented tool_manager_push_tool()
	and tool_manager_pop_tool().

2001-02-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/bucket_fill.[ch]: one more...

	* app/tools/fuzzy_select.c: everything commented out except the
	find_region stuff.

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c: cosmetic.

	* app/tools/paint_options.c: #include "bucket_fill.h"

	* app/tools/tool.[ch]: removed STUB()'s.

	* app/tools/tools.c: register it.

2001-02-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/ink.[ch]: back as object.

	* app/tools/paint_options.c: #include "ink.h"

	* app/tools/tool.h: removed the type #define.

	* app/tools/tools.c: register it.

2001-02-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/context_manager.[ch]: made the global_paint_options public.

	* app/tools/gimptoolinfo.[ch]: added a "tool_context" boolean to
	the constructor and create a private context for the tool
	initialized with global_paint_options' values.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]: changed tool_manager_register_tool()
	accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c
	* app/tools/measure.c
	* app/tools/move.c
	* app/tools/text_tool.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/paint_options.[ch]: added the fade out and gradient
	options here so they can be used by all paint tools.

	* app/tools/gimppaintbrushtool.c: removed them here. Changed
	the non_gui stuff: removed the non_gui_paint_func and handle
	the non_gui stuff in the normal paint method. Allocate a
	non_gui_paintbrush instead of the old non_gui_paint_core.

	The non_gui stuff will change totally and will be handled
	by GimpPaintTool only.

	* app/tools/tool.c: removed the STUB()'s again.

2001-02-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am: build the measure tool again.

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c: correct prototypes for some
	functions so we don't get warnings about incompatible assignments
	in "class_init", chain up in "control".

	* app/tools/gimpdrawtool.c: added an implementation of "control"
	which can be called from subclasses so we don't need to call
	GimpDrawTool's methods directly from there.

	* app/tools/gimppaintbrushtool.[ch]: create it's tool options so it
	doesn't crash. Commented out the non_gui stuff. We need a different
	interface for this.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.[ch]: some cleanups: call the draw tool's
	"control" function, fixed "cursor_update", fixed indentation.

	* app/tools/measure.[ch]: made it work again (properly subclass
	GimpDrawTool).

	* app/tools/tool.c: re-added the non_gui paintbrush STUB()'s

	* app/tools/tools.c: don't allocate the non_gui stuff.
	GimpPaintTool is an abstract superclass, so we cannot create
	an instance of it. Moreover, the current non_gui stuff assumes
	that there is something like a "paint_core" and changes it's
	virtual function pointers, breaking the object system totally.

2001-02-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/header.c: applied patch from Chuck Mason 
	<chuckjr@unbounded.com> that fixes wrong output of header plug-in.

2001-02-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpdrawablelistview.[ch]: new widget. The upcoming replacement
	for the layers and channels dialogs.

	* app/test_commands.[ch]: put the test dialogs here...

	* app/commands.[ch]: ... and made this one clean again.

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]: some signal handling fine tuning.

	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: emits "active_layer_changed" and
	"active_channel_changed" signals now. The semantics of
	gimage->active_layer and gimage->active_channel have changed a bit.
	We now have either an active layer _or_ and active channel (there
	is no active layer any more if a channel is active).

	* app/channel_ops.c
	* app/floating_sel.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/menus.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c: actually assign the draw_class
	vraiable in the class_init function.

	* app/tools/gimpdrawtool.[ch]
	* app/tools/tool.c: removed the _new() functions because these
	objects are abstract superclasses. Did some cleanup.
	Nathan, please configure you editor to _not_ produce any tabs
	in the source code.

	* app/tools/gimppaintbrushtool.[ch]: "blurb" and "help" are tagged
	with _(), not N_(). Put the register function to the header.

	* po/POTFILES.in: made it compile again.

2001-02-26  Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

        * app/tools/gimppainttool.c
        * app/tools/gimppainttool.h
        * app/tools/gimppainttool_kernels.h: Created GimpDrawTool and

        PaintCore

	* app/layer_select.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/undo.c
	* app/xcf.c
	* app/tools/move.c: remove direct access of gimage->active_layer and
	gimage->active_channel. Reading access is of course harmless, but
	gimp_image_set_active_blah() will trigger a signal emission soon.

	It will probably be neccessary to change the functions to accept
	NULL layers and channels to acheive exactly what weird places like
	floating_sel.c did before by setting it directly.

	* gimptool-1.4.in
	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimpcolor/Makefile.am
	* libgimpmath/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/Makefile.am: made linking against stable
	GIMP installed in the same prefix work again by renaming all our
	libraries explicitly to libgimp<foo>-1.3.* (not as part of the
	libtool release but as part of the library name). Removed the
	libtool release to avoid double versioning. This has to be
	hardcoded in the libraries' Makefile.am ...

2001-02-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/pixmaps2.h: commented out "text_width" and "text_height"

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/text_tool.[ch]: "It was really dead, Jim!"

	* app/tools/tool.c: removed STUBs

	* app/tools/tools.c: register it.

2001-02-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml: updated.

	* app/appenums.h
	* app/apptypes.h: prefixed the cursor stuff with "Gimp", added
	the new stock tool cursor enum. Removed the old ToolType enum.

	* app/cursorutil.[ch]
	* app/gdisplay.[ch]: removed the old ToolType enum and prefixed
	the functions with "gimp_". Also stripped all "toggle cursor"
	stuff from the cursor code, so the new API is easier and not
	depending on the tool system.

	All existing tool cursors can be used via the new stock tool
	cursor enum, so no tool has to fiddle around with bitmap cursors.
	There will be an cursorutil function for registering stock tool
	cursor types on the fly.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/scroll.[ch]: moved the display scrollbar callbacks from
	scroll.[ch] to disp_callbacks.c. Removed some crap from scroll.h

	* app/tools/tool.[ch]: removed the BitmapCursor pointers from the
	tool class struct and add cursor and toggle cursor IDs to the
	GimpTool struct. Work in progress.

	* app/dialog_handler.c
	* app/tools/bezier_select.c
	* app/tools/blend.c
	* app/tools/bucket_fill.c

	* app/tools/scale_tool.c
	* app/tools/shear_tool.c
	* app/tools/text_tool.c
	* app/tools/transform_core.[ch]: changed accordingly. Did this
	"blind" for most tools because they don't compile. The changes are
	minimal, so there should be no conflicts.

2001-02-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.[ch]: added cmd_callbacks for the toolbox and
	the preferences dialog.

	* app/context_manager.c: cleanup.

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: made gimp_preview_render() public.

	* app/gimptoolinfopreview.c
	* app/tools/gimptoolinfo.c: the tool previews look nice now but
	are still ugly implemented (it renders tons of temp_bufs on each
	state change).

	* app/indicator_area.[ch]: pass a context to the constructor.

	* app/menus.c: don't call the toolbox and the prefs dialog
	directly but dispatch via commands.[ch]

	* app/preferences_dialog.[ch]
	* app/toolbox.[ch]: renamed the constructor / raise function, cleanup.

	* app/tools/color_picker.c: tried to get the shortcut working again.

	* app/tools/paint_options.c: the brush dialog's paint options
	are shown/hidden from the context manager now.

2001-02-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: removed crap from ancient times when tools
	used to be an enum.

	* app/brush_select.[ch]: cleaned up the gui and made global paint
	mode toggling much simpler by expanding vertically instead of
	reparenting.

	* app/context_manager.c: removed hack by using a tool manager
	accessor function.

	* app/gimpcontext.c: use the new standard tool info object. Tools
	also _behave_ like all other data types now (can e.g. be
	refreshed).

	* app/tools/tool.[ch]

	* app/tools/gimptoolinfo.[ch]: added an "identifier" which is an
	untranslated string with a meaningful prefix and name, e.g.
	"gimp:color_picker_tool". Renamed "tool_name" and "tool_desc"
	to "blurb" and "help", changed the constructor accordingly.
	Added gimp_tool_info_get_standard() to make the context work
	with tool refresh.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]
	* app/tools/tools.c: removed the global list of tool class
	structures because the tool info list is in place.
	Added tool_manager_register_tool_options() which calls
	tool_options_dialog_add() and registers the options in the
	global_tool_info_list.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/paint_options.[ch]
	* app/tools/selection_options.[ch]
	* app/tools/tool_options.[ch]
	* app/tools/tool_options_dialog.[ch]: build them all again. This
	is mostly the old tool options system with minor modifications to
	work with the new stuff. The tool options auto-update with the user
	context now, so there are no update functions any more.

	* app/gimpdnd.c
	* app/toolbox.c
	* app/tools/color_picker.c
	* app/tools/measure.c
	* app/tools/move.c: changed accordingly.

2001-02-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimptoolinfopreview.[ch]: new widget.

	* app/gimppreview.c
	* app/tools/gimptoolinfo.c
	* app/gimpdnd.c: changed for the tool info preview. Still buggy
	and looks a bit funny at the moment :-)

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: small new feature: shift-X toggles the whole context.

2001-02-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/pixmaps.h
	* app/wilber.h: removed some data files from app/

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am
	* pixmaps/default.xpm
	* pixmaps/swap.xpm
	* pixmaps/wilber3.xpm: added them here.

	* app/pixmaps2.h: added the "dialog_bits" stuff here.

	* app/tips_dialog.c
	* app/toolbox.c: use the new XPMs and remove hacks which created
	the GdkPixmaps and GtkPreviews manually.

2001-02-22  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c
	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/gdisplay.c: Icons now update every 7.5 seconds in the
	idle loop. Also the aspect ratio is correct now. Mitch promised
	to hack a preferences option to disable this stuff...  :-)

Thu Feb 22 18:23:10 GMT 2001  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/channel.pdb: Save a bunch of slow-witted
	old people like myself from having to upgrade PERL for the sake
	of sugar.  Baby.

2001-02-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: forgot one s/gimptool/gimptool-1.4/

	* app/appenums.h: removed "UPDATE_CURSOR" from the ToolAction enum.

	* app/context_manager.c: removed the toolbox toggle button updating
	code here...

	* app/toolbox.c: ...and handle it in the toolbox itself.

	* app/devices.c: removed some obsolete old tool suff.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/move.[ch]: reactivated. Disabled the edit_selection
	stuff for now. We need a way to temporary push tools to some stack
	of the tool manager.

	* app/tools/tool.[ch]: removed lot of stuff that is obsolete or
	handled by the GimpToolInfo object now.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]: stripped all tool options stuff
	because they will be able to follow tool changes themselves.
	Renamed some functions to be consistent.

	* app/tools/tools.c: register the move tool again.

	* app/cursorutil.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/global_edit.c
	* app/tools/color_picker.c
	* app/tools/measure.[ch]
	* app/tools/tool_options.c: changed accordingly.

2001-02-21  Simon Budig   <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/interface.c: Moved the Icon preview stuff to the idle-loop.

2001-02-21  Simon Budig   <simon@gimp.org>
	
	* app/interface.c: Fixed stupid bug with the icon preview when
	creating the second preview. Please note that it still crashes
	on the second image, but this is hopefully not my fault...  :-)

2001-02-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Made the tool system work again and integrated it back with the
	GimpContext. It's a hack between old, new and freshly hacked
	stuff. There are still lots of warnings but at least we can switch
	tools again.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am
	* app/tools/gimptoolinfo.[ch]: resurrected as real object.
	The GimpToolInfo objects are derived from GimpData, which gives
	us the tool icon stuff for free. Also, we need a list of _objects_
	which is allocated all the time. All tools are required to have
	a "register" function which registers themselves with the list
	of GimpToolInfo objects which is maintained by the tool manager.

	* app/tools/tool.[ch]: made a real GtkObject with properly named
	functions out of it. The former "active_tool_control" is of
	course not the default implementation of the tool's "control"
	method but a hack _around_ it, so it went to the tool manager.

	* app/tools/color_picker.[ch]
	* app/tools/measure.[ch]: ditto. Added "register" functions and
	"destroy" implementations so the tools go away after use.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]: badly hacked at the moment to keep
	both the list of class structures _and_ the tool info list.

	* app/tools/tools.c: call the tools' register functions.

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: store a pointer to a GimpToolInfo object
	as "active_tool" in the context, so we're independent of tools
	being allocated or not. It's treated just like a brush or pattern
	now.

	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: made tool DND work like all other DND types.

	* app/devices.[ch]: also here: the tool is just a normal data object
	now, resulting in removal of lots of code.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/context_manager.c: updated the tool select and context stuff
	to work again.

	* app/toolbox.c: removed the old pixmap buttons and put GimpPreviews
	inside the tool buttons. Still needs an own preview type to
	look nice.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/about_dialog.c
	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/appenums.h
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/gimppalette.c
	* app/gimppreview.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/palette_select.h
	* app/scale.c
	* app/scroll.c: lots of changes to make it work again.

2001-02-21  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* app/gimpchecks.h: New file containing the check types.
	
	* app/image_render.h: ... definitions taken from here.
	* app/temp_buf.c:
	* app/temp_buf.h: New function temp_buf_new_check to create
	a new checked temp_buf.

2001-02-20  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>
	
	* app/gdisplay.[ch]
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c: Added preliminary support for Preview icons.

	This is not finished: We need a better way to get previews with
	a specific depth and probably a rendered Checkerboard for the
	alpha channel. Also the update function is now bound to a click
	in the top left menu-button and should go in some idle-stuff.
	Please test this on various window managers and give some
	feedback. The last point is the aspect ratio of the generated
	previews...

2001-02-20  Nick Lamb  <njl195@zepler.org.uk>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c: include string.h

2001-02-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: removed all brush, pattern, gradient and palette
	DND functions because there are generic GimpViewable DND functions
	now.

	* app/disp_callbacks.[ch]
	* app/interface.c: changed accordingly.

2001-02-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: first version of the new layers and channels dialogs.

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c: allow creation with a NULL container.

	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: added generic DND functions for all drawable
	types (not just setting the DND icon). Started to remove code
	duplication.

	* app/gimpdrawablepreview.c: with some magic calculations and ugly
	assumptions the drawable previews now look exactly like in the old
	L&C dialog.

	* app/gimpimagepreview.c: no need to say "return" at the end of a
	void function.

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: added the "is_popup" boolean also to the
	default constructor. Call gimp_preview_set_viewable() before
	calculating the preview size.

2001-02-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimppalette-import.[ch]: new files. The import functions
	stripped from all UI crap.

	* app/palette_import.c: removed from here.

2001-02-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: converted gimage->layers and gimage->channels
	to GimpLists.
	
	* app/channel_ops.c

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/display.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: changed accordingly

2001-02-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainer.[ch] (gimp_container_insert): new function.

2001-02-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/context_manager.c
	* app/gimpdatafactory.c
	* app/gimpdatalist.[ch]
	* app/gimplist.[ch]
	* app/module_db.c: return a GimpContainer from all container
	subclass constructors.

	* app/gimppalettepreview.c
	* app/palette.c: changed the preview a bit. Still ugly.

2001-02-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* gimp.m4
	* gimptool.in: removed.

	* gimp-1.4.m4
	* gimptool-1.4.in: added modified versions. gimp-1.4.m4 is untested.
	The m4 macro is now called AM_PATH_GIMP_1_4()

	* .cvsignore
	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in: changed accordingly.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimpcolor/Makefile.am
	* libgimpmath/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am: install the header files in
	$includedir/gimp-MAJOR.MINOR/<libname>

	* app/brush_edit.c: increased toplevel container border size to 4.

	* app/gimpdatafactoryview.c: don't generate multiple "copy"s when
	duplicating data objects.

	* app/gradient_editor.c: cleaned up the GUI.

	* app/lc_dialog.c: removed the "Close" button.

2001-02-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: added DND source functions which work by
	GtkType.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/gradient_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select.c: removed the DND code here because it's all
	done by the GimpContainerView now.

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimpgradientpreview.c
	* app/gimppalettepreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c: use the DND by-type connect functions.

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c: implemented "duplicate", cleanup.

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]: added a "activate_item" signal
	method which is emitted by the subclasses to indicate double click.

	* app/gimpdatafactoryview.c: connect to "activate_item" and show
	the editor.

	* app/convert.c
	* app/gimppalette.[ch]
	* app/palette.c
	* app/paletteP.h
	* app/palette_import.c
	* app/palette_select.[ch]: major cleanup: Behaves like the other
	datatypes now: DND, context stuff, GimpContainerListViews in
	the dialogs etc. Mostly just removal of code.

	* app/gradient_editor.c: fixed signal blocking/unblocking.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am: install the "Test Sphere"
	script again.

2001-02-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainer.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]
	* app/gimplist.c
	* app/gimpmarshal.[ch]: the GimpContainer has a new virtual "reorder"
	method which is much more eficient then the current remove/add
	braindeadness when renaming data objects.
	Changed the views to connect to "reorder" and call the
	GimpContainerView's new "reorder_item" method which then does
	the right thing in the view subclasses.

	* app/gimpdatafactory.c
	* app/gimpdatafactoryview.c
	* app/gimpdatalist.[ch]: removed the data list loading and saving
	stuff from GimpDataList because that's the job of the
	GimpDataFactory.

	* app/brush_edit.[ch]
	* app/brush_select.c: cleanup.

	* app/gradient_editor.[ch]: changed it to work like the brush
	editor: return a GradientEditor pointer in the constructor
	and statically store this pointer in the gradient selection file.
	Removed the global "g_editor" variable and added tons of
	GradientEditor* variables to function calls so they know their
	context without the global variable.

	* app/gradient_select.c: changed accordingly.

2001-02-17  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* app/tools/Makefile.am 
        * app/tools/measure.[ch]: added back in, changing as needed for basic 
	operation.  Probably pretty buggy still.

	* app/tools/tools.c: changed one of the tool initializations to be
	the measure tool.  Now only measure tools are availble (though it
	would appear both are visually).  I don't think the toolbox selection 
	stuff is operational yet.

	* app/tools/color_picker.[ch]: minor cleanup

2001-02-16  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

        On request of Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>.
        * plugins/common/despeckle.c: Fixed comparison *sort_ptr > black_level.
        Only adopting white_level had a visual effect. This fix causes
        that also adopting blck_level works also.

2001-02-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* HACKING: added a note about apptype.h and about not including
	headers in headers.

	* app/apptypes.h: added GimpTool and BitmapCursor.

	* app/cursorutil.h
	* app/devices.h
	* app/draw_core.h

	"module_db_load_inhibit".

	* app/module_db.c: removed the above variable here.

	* app/gimpdata.[ch]: added a vitrual "duplicate" method.

	* app/gimpbrush.[ch]

	* app/gimppattern.[ch]: all "load", "new" and "get_standard"
	functions return a GimpData pointer now.

	* app/gimpdatafactory.[ch]: made some stuff const.

	* app/gimpdatafactoryview.c: activate the "duplicate" button and
	set the initial button sensitivity correctly.

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c: use the new GimpDataFactoryView.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: grouped the file to sort out what _may_
	go to subdirs or separate libs.

	* libgimp/gimpenv.[ch]: added many "const".

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/brush_edit.c
	* app/gimpcontext.c
	* app/gimpdnd.c
	* app/gradient_editor.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/palette_import.c
	* app/user_install.c: many related changes.

	* libgimpmath/gimpmathtypes.h
	* libgimpmath/gimpvector.[ch]: minor cleanups.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c: gimp_data_directory() is const now.

2001-02-13 Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/plugin-helper/*: prototype for an extension that allows
	gmodules as plugins.  Known bug: crashes on gmodules with a static
	"query" function
        
	* app/tools/tool.c 
	* app/tools/tool.h: created new GimpTool object.  Did away with
	ToolInfo.  Most tools still need to be ported over to the new api.

        * app/tools/tools.c: now contains the initialization function to
	register the tools with the Gimp

        * app/tools/tools.h: renamed to tool.h

	* app/Makefile.am 
	* app/app_procs.c

	* user_install

	because all data types will be editable and saveable soon.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimpdatafactory.[ch]: new object which holds a data list and
	knows how to create, edit, duplicate etc. the items in it. Will
	completely replace the brushes.[ch], patterns.[ch], ... files soon.

	* po/POTFILES.in
	* app/gimpdatacontainerview.[ch]: removed.
	* app/gimpdatafactoryview.[ch]: added.

	A view on the GimpDataFactory with a GUI for creating, editing,
	deleting etc. items (mostly unimplemented).

	* app/context_manager.[ch]: replaced the global data lists by global
	data factories.

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/brushes.[ch]

2001-02-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* po/POTFILES.in
	* app/gimpdatacontainerview.[ch]: new widget which will replace the
	current brush, pattern, ... selections. To really use it, there
	needs to be a GimpDataFactory object (coming soon...)

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: added test data container views.

	* app/paint_funcs_simd.S: #include the implementation with "", not <>

2001-02-13  Seth Burgess  <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in
	* cursors/Makefile.am

	directories

2001-02-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2001-02-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gradient_editor.[ch]
	* app/gradient_select.[ch]: use GimpContainerListView instead of
	cooking an own list.

	* app/gimpgradient.[ch]: removed the GdkPixmap from the gradient.

	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c: connect the viewable's "name_changed"
	signal to the label.

	* app/gimpmarshal.[ch]
	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: new virtual function "get_size",

	* app/gimpgradientpreview.c: implement "get_size" and return a 3:1
	aspect ratio.

	* app/gradients.c
	* app/palette_select.[ch]
	* app/palettes.c: removed the dialog freeze/thaw functions.

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/plug_in.c: stuff.

2001-02-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select.[ch]: removed almost all code by using
	the GimpContainerGridView.

	* app/brushes.c
	* app/patterns.c: brush|pattern_select_freeze|thaw_all() don't
	exist any more.

	* app/devices.c: made it work again.

	* app/gimpgradientpreview.c: the gradient popup is 128 x 32 again.

	* app/plug_in.c: follow the brush and pattern dialog function
	renaming.

	* app/gimppalette.[ch]
	* app/gimppalettepreview.c: added a "Columns" attribute and show
	the popups accordingly.

	The palette file format has changed again. It now can have an
	optional "Columns: <n>" line after the palette's name.

	* data/palettes/Bgold.gpl
	* data/palettes/Borders.gpl
	* data/palettes/Cascade.gpl
	* data/palettes/China.gpl
	* data/palettes/Coldfire.gpl
	* data/palettes/Dark_pastels.gpl

	* data/palettes/Plasma.gpl
	* data/palettes/Visibone.gpl
	* data/palettes/Visibone_2.gpl
	* data/palettes/Web.gpl: added the "Columns" parameter where it
	makes sense and removed those ugly black colors which were hanging
	around as first color of many palettes.

2001-02-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am: took gimpcontextpreview.[ch] out of the build
	but still left the sources there as reference.

	* app/app_procs.c: initialize the render stuff before creating the
	toolbox (needed for the previews).

	* app/devices.c
	* app/indicator_area.c: use GimpPreviews instead of
	GimpContextPreviews.

	* app/context_manager.[ch]: create the global data lists here
	because they now must exist before any context is created.

	* app/brushes.[ch]
	* app/gradients.[ch]
	* app/palettes.[ch]
	* app/patterns.[ch]: removed them here.

	* app/gimpcontainer.[ch]: added a "freeze_count" and emit the
	"freeze" and "thaw" signals accordingly.

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: greatly simplified the way how the
	contexts connect to the data lists (simply keep them connected all
	the time). Also removed all those ugly explicit update functions
	because "thaw" callbacks do this job now.

	* app/gimpdata.c: a GimpData object now becomes dirty on
	"name_changed"; "dirty" now triggers "invalidate_preview" because
	the context does not dispatch these signals any more soon.

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/convert.c

2001-02-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/apptypes.h: added the datafile loader_func typedefs.

	* app/datafiles.h: removed from here.

	* app/gimpcontainer.[ch]: emit "freeze" and "thaw" signals to get
	rid of those blah_select_[freeze|thaw]_all() stuff.

	* app/gimpdatalist.[ch]: new function gimp_data_list_load() which
	takes a va_list of GimpDataObjectLoaderFuncs and file extensions
	and is almost a replacement for the four files below.

	* app/brushes.c
	* app/gradients.c
	* app/palettes.c
	* app/patterns.c: very simple now. It may be worth thinking about
	making all GimpData subclasses managed by a descriptive array in
	the context_manager.

2001-02-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Made a GimpContainer out of the palette list:

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/palettes.[ch]: new files for the global palette list.

	* app/gimpgradientpreview.[ch]
	* app/gimppalettepreview.[ch]: new widgets.

	* app/gimppalette.[ch]: derive it from GimpData to get all the
	preview etc. stuff.

	* app/datafiles.[ch]: new function datafiles_check_extension(),
	added a "loader_data" parameter to datafiles_read_directories()
	and pass it to the loader function.

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: added the palette (not really used yet
	except by the test dialogs).

	* app/gimpdatalist.[ch]: new function gimp_data_list_save_and_clear()
	which does everything needed for patterns_free(), brushes_free() ...

	* app/gimpdnd.c: added palette DND.

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/brushes.c
	* app/color_notebook.h
	* app/commands.c
	* app/convert.c
	* app/gimpbrush.h
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.h
	* app/gimpgradient.c
	* app/gimppattern.h
	* app/gimppreview.c
	* app/gradients.c
	* app/module_db.c
	* app/palette.[ch]
	* app/paletteP.h
	* app/palette_import.c
	* app/palette_select.[ch]
	* app/patterns.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/pdb/convert_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/palette_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/convert.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/palette.pdb: lotsa stuff: changed due to the above
	API changes, #define the file extensions in the GimpData subclasses'
	header files instead of hardcoding them in several places, ...

	* data/palettes/*: The same file format change as for the gradient
	files:

	- Save the palette name in a parsable form (as part of the file
	  format, not in a comment.
	- Removed unserscores from the palette names.
	- Added an extension (Gimp PaLettes are ".gpl" files now ;-)

2001-02-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimpdata.[ch]: new abstract base class for everything
	(except images) which has a filename and can become dirty and must
	be saved.

	* app/gimpbrush.[ch]
	* app/gimpgradient.[ch]
	* app/gimppattern.[ch]: all derived from GimpData now.

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.[ch]
	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/brushes.c
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c
	* app/gradient_editor.c
	* app/gradients.c
	* app/patterns.c: removed lots of code duplication due to common
	file save magic.

	The gradient file format has changed: it now contains the
	gradient's name (no more ugly underscores). The files have the
	extension ".ggr".

	* app/gimpgradient.[ch]: save new gradients, load new and old
	gradients.

	* data/gradients/*: removed all old gradients and added the new
	ones.

2001-02-10  David Monniaux  <monniaux@genievre.ens.fr>

	MMX code for paint_funcs. Very partial so far.
	* acconfig.h
	* configure.in: detection of MMX-able assembler and compiler
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/main.c: detects MMX and acts accordingly
	* app/paint_funcs.c
	* app/paint_funcs_simd.S: #include's appropriate file
	* app/arch/i386/mmx/paint_funcs_mmx.S
	* app/arch/i386/mmx/paint_funcs_mmx.S.m4

2001-02-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gradient.[ch]: renamed...

	* app/gradient_editor.[ch]: ...to this

	* app/gradient_select.c: changed #include

	* po/POTFILES.in: renamed the file here too

2001-02-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gradientP.h
	* app/gradient_header.h: removed.

	* app/gimpgradient.[ch]: new object -- bye bye "gradient_t"

	* app/gradients.[ch]: new files for managing the gradient list.

	* app/gradient.[ch]: contains only the gradient editor now (which
	still badly pokes around in the GimpGradient structure).

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/devices.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontextpreview.[ch]
	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]
	* app/gradient_select.[ch]
	* app/indicator_area.c
	* app/palette_import.c
	* app/pdb/gradient_select_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/gradients_cmds.c
	* app/tools/airbrush.c
	* app/tools/blend.c
	* app/tools/paint_core.c
	* app/tools/paintbrush.c
	* app/tools/pencil.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_select.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradients.pdb: changed accordingly, some
	changes to the preview and view stuff.

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: removed the "context" attribute again
	because it was overkill (a simple gtk_signal_connect_object does
	the same as doing the autoconnection magic inside the GimpPreview
	object).

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: example views on the gradient container.

2001-02-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]: follow the GimpPreview API change
	and take only "size" instead of "width" and "height" in the
	constructor.

	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: first attempt to hack GtkType based DND which
	speaks in terms of GimpViewable instead of Brush, Pattern, ...
	Added functions to remove DND callbacks (used by the multi-views).

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: new function gimp_preview_set_size_full().

	* app/commands.c: updated the example dialogs to be DND aware.

	* app/gimpimage.c: fixed preview size calculation by ensuring a
	minimal width/height of 1 pixel.
	Reported by Dave Neary <dneary@eircom.net>

2001-02-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: moved the constructor-parameter-overkill
	to the new function gimp_preview_new_full() and made the
	gimp_preview_new() interface simple.

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c: added DND support.

	* app/gimpdnd.c: use the new preview system.

	* app/gimpconstrainedhwrapbox.c: implement "size_allocate". Ok,
	this is silly -- I will write an own widget which does the
	"scrollable grid of whatever" stuff in one place...

	* app/commands.c
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpimagepreview.c: follow the GimpPreview constructor change.

2001-02-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c: changed the test dialogs a bit.

	* app/gimpconstrainedhwrapbox.[ch]: should be called
	GimpHackedWrapBoxForContainerView now ;-)

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]: fixed the minimal size setting
	by getting the magic values from the relevan gtk widgets.
	Scroll to the active item if it not visible.

2001-02-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: added an (unused) "context" argument
	and a "set_viewable" function.

	* app/gimpconstrainedhwrapbox.c: even more evil than before.

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerview.c
	* app/gimpimagepreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c: fixed lots of forgotten signal handlers

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: added "Multi View" dialogs.

2001-02-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: added a "border" attribute. The border can
	have any color (which has no sane API yet...). Added "width" and
	"height" attributes and provide a "set_size" function.

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpimagepreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c: changed accordingly, enabled
	highlighting of the selected item in the grid views.

2001-02-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: allocate less temp_bufs by removing the
	"create_preview" virtual function and adding a "render" one.

	Implementations have to call the new public function
	gimp_preview_render_and_flush() to render their temp_bufs.
	This way, e.g. the GimpPatternPreview can render the preview
	directly from the pattern's mask.

	* app/gimpdrawablepreview.c
	* app/gimpimagepreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.[ch]: same as above and added BrushPipe
	popup animation.

2001-02-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]
	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpimagepreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c: added an "is_popup" parameter to the
	preview constructor so the subclasses can decide if to do special
	stuff like pipe animation.

2001-02-07  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* configure.in: Changed link order in gtkxmhtml check
	to fix bug #12653.

2001-02-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: added "set_by_type", "get_by_type" and
	"changed_by_type" methods which take a GtkType and decide from
	that if to manipulate the Brush, Pattern etc.

	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]: added a GimpContext to the views
	which is used to manage the active item.

	* app/commands.c: pass the user_context to the test views.

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c
	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: added a virtual "needs_popup" method which
	returns a boolean indicating if the viewable is already fully
	visible.

	* app/gimage.[ch]: removed gimage_foreach() and some other
	functions which can easily be done by gimp_container_foreach().
	Removed gimage_delete().

	* app/fileops.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/lc_dialog.c
	* app/nav_window.c
	* app/palette_import.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/xcf.c
	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: changed accordingly. Switched from
	"disp_count" refcounting to real GtkObject refcounting for
	GimpImages.

2001-02-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrush.[ch]
	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c: moved the scale and pipe indicator
	rendering code from GimpBrush to GimpBrushPreview.
	Removed the "dirty" signal from GimpBrush and use
	"invalidate_preview" of the GimpViewable class.

	* app/brush_edit.c
	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c
	* app/gimpcontext.c
	* app/gimpcontextpreview.c
	* app/tools/paint_core.c: changed accordingly.

2001-02-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpimagepreview.[ch]: new object with own implementations
	of "create_preview" and "create_popup".

	* app/gimpdrawablepreview.c: stuff... still unused.

	* app/gimppreview.c: fixed idle rendering crashes, don't
	forget popups on GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS.

	* app/app_procs.c: gimpbrushlist.h doesn't exist any more.

	* app/gimpobject.h: removed the GimpObject typedef because it
	is in apptypes.h

2001-02-07  Hans Breuer <Hans@Breuer.org>

	* */makefile.msc : Gimp 1.3 for win32 (msc) builds and runs at 
	this short moment, it's a fast moving target nowadays :-)

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c
	* app/gimppattern.c : make sure G_OS_WIN32 is defined (by glib.h 
	inclusion) before actually using it

	* app/plug_in.h 
	* app/datafiles.h : <time.h> for time_t

	* app/tile_swap.c : include <stdio.h> for SEEK_SET

	* app/gimpcontainer.c : use G_GNUC_FUNCTION instead of 
	__FUNCTION__ to allow compiling without gcc

	* app/dialog_handler.h : don't use conditional prototypes
	for gmodule exported function but include <gmodule.h> and
	use G_MODULE_EXPORT in prototype, too.

	* app/gimpobject.h : added typedef for GimpObject

	* libgimp/gimp.def : more exported symbols

	* libgimp/gimpcolorselector.h : #include <gmodule.h> for
	G_MODULE_EXPORT,  sane prototypes.

	* libgimp/gimpui.def : symbol export update, splitted to
	gimpwidgets.def

	* libgimpcolor/gimpcolor.def
	* libgimpmath/gimpmath.def
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def : updated

	* libgimpwidgets/libgimp-glue.c : new file which supports
	real dynamic linking on win32, against exported symbols from
	the application or libgimp. This allows to resolve the
	double dependency for currently 11 functions

2001-02-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpdrawable-preview.[ch]: new files formerly known as
	gimpdrawablepreview.[ch].

	This a new naming scheme for methods of objects which live outside
	their object's file. The old name implied a derived object (and
	is in fact now taken by a GimpPreview subclass, see below).

	Further candidates for renaming are e.g. gimpdrawable-invert.[ch],
	gimpimage-convert.[ch] etc.  Finaly, the main objects (image,
	drawable) will go to their own directories together with their
	subclasses.

	* app/apptypes.h: added typedefs for the new objects:

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.[ch]
	* app/gimppatternpreview.[ch]: new subclasses of GimpPreview.

	* app/gimpdrawablepreview.[ch]: contains a subclass of GimpPreview
	now.

	* app/gimpviewable.[ch]: renamed the virtual functions to
	"get_preview" and "get_new_preview" to avoid confusion with the
	new GimpPreview subclasses.

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: virtualized "create_preview" and
	"create_popup".

	* app/gimpmarshal.[ch]: new marsaller for GimpPreview.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gimpdnd.c
	* app/gimpdrawable.c
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/gimppattern.c
	* app/layer_select.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/lc_dialog.c
	* app/nav_window.c
	* app/palette_import.c
	* app/undo_history.c
	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: changed accordingly.

2001-02-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]: added "min_items_x" and
	"min_items_y" parameters to the constructors.

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: added event handling for "click" and
	"popup", show a dummy popup for testing.

	* app/commands.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/menus.c: added a separator and removed N_() from the test stuff.

2001-02-06  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

        * libgimpwidgets/gimpdialog.c

	fixed the documentation.

2001-02-06  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpdialog.c
	* app/tools/tool_options_dialog.c

	Implemented a way to connect the delete-event of a gimpdialog
	without adding an extra button. If you pass "_delete_event_"
	as button text (untranslated) the button will not be created.
	
	Removed the tool-options "Close" button. Lots of other Close-Buttons
	wait for their removal.

2001-02-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpconstrainedhwrapbox.[ch]: A bad hack on top of another
	hack: The GtkHWrapBox "size_request" method _always_ wants a
	maximal requisition height, which it of course gets from a
	container like the scrolled window, yielding in wrong vscrollbar
	calculation.

	* app/gimpbrush.c: create a nice preview with scale and pipe
	indicators.

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]: use the GimpConstrainedHWrapBox.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimppreview.c: cleanup, fixed a crash in the preview idle
	rendering function.

2001-02-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* data/brushes/hsparks.gih
	* data/brushes/vine.gih: seems we had forgotten to convert these
	to the new format.

2001-02-05  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* app/gimphistogram.c: Applied patches by Roel Schroeven
	<rschroev@yahoo.com> that fix histogram with mask calculation bug and
	median calculation bug.

2001-02-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]: add the spacing between the
	previews here instead of expecting an already bordered preview.
	Set the widget background to white.

	* app/gimppattern.c: removed the white border hack.

2001-02-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]: implemented "set_preview_size".

	* app/commands.c: added a preview size slider to the test dialogs.

2001-02-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpcontainergridview.[ch]: new widget providing a grid view
	in the style of the current brush and pattern selections.

	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]
	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: the constructors take "width" and "height"
	parameters now.

	* app/gimpviewable.c: if the viewable is not able to generate
	a static (cached) preview, create a new one and cache it ourselves.

	* app/gimppattern.c: produce a nice preview.

	* app/temp_buf.[ch]: changed temp_buf_copy_area() to take a
	destination offset instead of a border parameter. This function
	was not used at all before.

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: test dialogs for the grid view.

2001-02-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]
	* app/gimpmarshal.[ch]: moved the signal connecting stuff to the
	GimpContainerViewClass which has virtual functions for insert,
	remove and clear now which are implemented by the
	GimpContainerListViewClass.

2001-02-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontainer.[ch]
	* app/gimplist.[ch]: made the "get_by_name" and the "by_index"
	access functions methods of the GimpContainerClass. The semantic
	of this index is somewhat unclear if we have e.g. a hash table
	implementation but the container needs to have an order for the
	ContainerView. Finally, the ordering will be a feature of the
	ContainerView.

	* app/gimpmarshal.[ch]: marshallers needed for the new methods.

	* app/brushes.[ch]
	* app/patterns.[ch]: the public global brush and pattern lists
	are GimpContainers now (they are really GimpLists of course).

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.c
	* app/gimpcontext.c
	* app/gimpdnd.c
	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/pdb/brush_select_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/brushes_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/pattern_select_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/patterns_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brush_select.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brushes.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/pattern_select.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/patterns.pdb: changed accordingly.

2001-02-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h: some new files and data types:

	* app/gimppreview.[ch]: new widgets which provides a view
	of a GimpViewable.

	* app/gimpcontainerview.[ch]: new abstract widget base class for
	views of GimpContainers of GimpViewables

	* app/gimpcontainerlistview.[ch]: (still) simple implementation of
	a list view of the container.

	* app/gimpbrush.[ch]
	* app/gimppattern.[ch]: provide dumb implementations of the
	GimpViewable's "preview" method.

	* app/image_render.c: quick bad hack to enable preview sizes which
	are != "preview_size": Always allocate data chunks for previews up
	to 256 pixels width.

	* app/drawable.c: emit the "incalidate_preview" signal from
	drawable_update(). This may cause useless updates at the moment
	but as we want to move from explicit updates to signal-driven
	model-view stuff it's the right thing (TM).

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/interface.c
	* app/menus.c: Added a "Test dialogs" menu to the Toolbox.

	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpenums.h
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-constants.c
	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: propagated the new alpha channel stuff
	to the autogenerated files.

2001-02-05  Nick Lamb  <njl195@zepler.org.uk>

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.h: Initial commit of "Alpha" transparency channel

2001-02-04  Nick Lamb  <njl195@zepler.org.uk>

	* app/patterns.c: Missing <string.h> again

2001-02-04  Nick Lamb  <njl195@zepler.org.uk>

	* app/brushes.c: New file == new missing includes! <string.h>

2001-02-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/gimpviewable.[ch]: new object. Everything that can have a
	preview will be a GimpViewable. The virtual functions are
	"invalidate_preview", "preview" and "preview_new".

	* app/gimpmarshal.[ch]: new marshaller needed for the viewable.

	* app/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: derived from GimpViewable. Removed the
	preview stuff from the public interface.

	Made a single boolean out of GimpImage's "comp_preview_valid"
	array because we have only one composite preview.

	* app/gimplayer.c: made the preview stuff private.

	* app/gimppreviewcache.[ch]: removed gimp_preview_scale()...

	* app/temp_buf.[ch]: ...and added it as temp_buf_scale() here.

	* app/gimpdrawablepreview.[ch]: is a private method of
	GimpDrawable now.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/convert.c
	* app/drawable.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/floating_sel.c
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/gimpchannel.c
	* app/gimpcontainer.c
	* app/gimpdnd.c

	"lowlevel" (???) directories.

2001-01-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.[ch]: removed channel_update() because channel.c

	PDB code generation easier but is ugly when used in the app
	(see my comment in the log below).

	Contains:

2001-01-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/apptypes.h: removed the "Layer" typedef.

	* app/layer.[ch]: removed the defines of the old function names.

	Don't implement methods of the parent class (get_name, get_tattoo, ...)
	but define them as macros. They will go to a separate "pdb_glue.h"
	header because they are used only by the PDB to simplify code
	generation (no application file should say gimp_layer_get_tattoo()
	but always gimp_drawable_get_tatoo()).

2001-01-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimplayermask.[ch]: new files cut out of layer.[ch]. Renamed
	all functions to gimp_layes_mask_*(). removed artefacts like
	the ref/unref functions.

	* app/apptypes.h: removed the "LayerMask" typedef.

	* app/layer.[ch]: removed the layer mask stuff and renamed all
	functions to gimp_layer_*(). Added temporary typedefs for the old
	function names. The layer mask preview stuff is still there (should
	probably go to new layer_preview.{ch] files).

	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: added
	gimp_image_invalidate_[layer|channel]_previews() formerly known as
	[layer|channel]_invalidate_previews().

	* app/channel.[ch]: moved channel_layer_alpha() and 
	channel_layer_mask() here because they are methods of the Channel.

2001-01-26  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* libgimpmath/gimpvector.c:
	* libgimpmath/gimpvector.h: Added pass-by-value functions
	to allow code simplifications and functionchaining.

Thu Jan 25 10:22:39 PST 2001 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/channel.pdb: resurrected channel_set_color

2001-01-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpcompat.h: removed.

	The GIMP 1.0 API is not supported any more !!!

	* plug-ins/print/print-image-gimp.c
	* plug-ins/print/print.c
	* plug-ins/print/print_gimp.h: a quick fix for old compat cruft.
	This is temporary and will be replaced by Gimp-Print's development
	version.

	* plug-ins/xjt/xjpeg.c: use GimpRGB.

	to actually work now.

	* TODO.xml: updated

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: disabled build of gimp-perl until it has 
	catched up with the API changes in libgimp 

2001-01-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c (gimp_mem_size_entry_new): merged fix

2001-01-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in
	* gimptool.in: added the new library below.

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpchainbutton.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorarea.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorbutton.[ch]

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpunitmenu.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h: new shared library.

	Currently there are some ugly dependencies into libgimp. These
	will be removed and go to a "libgimpglue" library which will be
	a library for functions which share a common interface between
	plug-ins and the app but have different implementations.

	Include "libgimp/gimpunit.h" from "libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h"
	to simulate this upcoming separation.

Mon Jan 15 17:22:30 PST 2001 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: correct spelling of "lose" in revert dialog

2001-01-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.c: added a global color history of 16 colors.
	The "Add" button uses neither LRU nor pure right-shift order but
	something in between. The history is scheduled to go to sessionrc.

2001-01-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/devices.c: use a GimpColorArea for the foreground color in
	the Device Status dialog and added a background color

2001-01-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/color_picker.c: enable drags from and disable drops to
	the ColorArea in the color_info dialog. Changed the cursor_update
	function so it only displays the bad cursor when outside the image.

2001-01-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/devices.c
	* app/gimprc.c: save the foreground and background color as array
	of RGBA doubles in "devicerc".

2001-01-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.c: make use of GimpColorAreas. Added two
	buttons to set the color to black or white.

2001-01-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_water.c: the bottom position of the scale
	represents the minimal pressure now. Also removed the pressure
	value display because it's rather a matter of "more" or "less"
	than of an exact value.

2001-01-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.c
	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: tweaked dialog layout a bit.

	* modules/colorsel_water.c: removed all widgets except the color
	selector itself (the history and the "Reset" button will go
	to the ColorNotebook).

	* libgimp/gimpcolor.c
	* libgimp/gimpcolorspace.[ch]: All rgb_to_hsv functions:

	if r == g == b the difference between the max and min value
	is 0 and we should avoid to divide by it ;-)

2001-01-15  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/apptypes.h
	I broke the Toolbox. Now it works again. The ToolType-enum *must*
	match the order in the tool_info-Array.

2001-01-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpcolor.[ch]: added function gimp_rgb_intensity_uchar()

	* libgimp/gimpcolorbutton.c
	* plug-ins/common/apply_lens.c
	* plug-ins/common/blinds.c

	gimp_palette_[get|set]_[back|fore]ground_rgb() functions.

2001-01-14  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools.c:
	Reordered some tools. It is IMHO more logical to group the
	"paint-style" and the "blur/smudge"-Tools together.
	The Ordering up to now was a "historical" ordering: Not good...

	I am thinking about grouping the "Non-image modifying"-tools
	(Magnify, Colorpicker, Measure tool) together...
	
2001-01-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.[ch]

	* app/channel.[ch]
	* app/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* app/layer.[ch]: moved the "removed" signal from GimpChannel and
	GimpLayer to GimpDrawable.

	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: changed accordingly.

2001-01-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/docindex.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]:

	Removed the "has_filename" boolean from GimpImage:

	- to get the filename, ask for GimpObjects's name.
	- gimp_image_filename() returns the *display* filename (and will be
	  renamed to gimp_image_display_name() soon), i.e. returns
	  "Unnamed" if object->name == NULL.
	- no need any more to check if the filename is the "" string because
	  GimpImage overrides GimpObject's "name_changed" method and
	  sets the name to NULL if it was "".

2001-01-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged fixes from gimp-1-2:

	* app/menus.c
	* app/plug-in.c: added some sanity checks for passed string pointers
	to various public functions in an attempt to fix bug #37622.

	* plug-ins/common/sharpen.c: applied a patch from Jerome Zago 
        <jzago@ifhamy.insa-lyon.fr> that fixes a longstanding bug in the
        sharpen filter which sometimes got the last line wrong. 
	Fixes bug #34155.

	- Removed the "name" argument from all objects and use
	  GimpObject's name.
	- Use the same code in all "uniquefy name" functions (this
	  functionality will be a method of the "GimpContainer" class).
	- Renamed the parent instances of all objects to "parent instance".
	- Added missing instance and class cast macros.
	- Changed some "gchar *" to "const gchar *" parameters.

2001-01-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml: updated status

	* app/gimpcontext.c: added temporary functions to make it compile

	* libgimp/gimpcolorarea.c: added antialiasing

2001-01-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpcolorbutton.[ch]: allow width/height of the color_area
	to be set to negative values so the GimpColorButton can be set up
	resizeable.
	
2001-01-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* README: changed for gimp-1.3

2001-01-11  Valek Filippov  <frob@df.ru>

	* plug-ins/script-fu.c: changed INIT_I18N() to INIT_I18N_UI().

2001-01-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpcolorarea.[ch]: finished new GimpColorArea widget which
	uses GimpRGB and handles DND and alpha channel.

	* libgimp/gimpcolorbutton.[ch]: use GimpColorArea. The API of the 
	GimpColorButton has changed!

	* libgimp/gimpwidgets.[ch]: added temporary function 
	gimp_color_update_uchar() to ease migration of plug-ins to GimpRGB. 
	This function will go away.
	
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.h

	might have broken some of these plug-ins. This is work in progress.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: added GimpColorArea and GimpColorButton to 
	libgimpi.
	
	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: added gimp_palette_get_[fore|back]ground() 
	functions so the app can link against libgimp/gimpcolorbutton.o.
	These functions will go away.

	* app/gimpdnd.c: use a GimpColorArea for DND
	
2001-01-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged fix from gimp-1-2:
	
	* app/gimpbrushlist.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/patterns.c: check for NULL pointers before doing strcmp on
	default names. The default names for brushes, patterns, ... can 
	be NULL if they were not set in a readable gimprc file.

	* app/gimprc.c: warn the user if the systemwide gimprc couldn't be
	read.

2001-01-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.c: Show the "Alpha" scale only when needed.

	* libgimp/gimpcolorarea.[ch]: fixed typos.

2001-01-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml: add more stuff

	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: applied patch from Oliver Lavery 
	<oliver@zeroknowledge.com> that adds new blending modes 
	(Dodge/Burn/Hardlight). Please play with these new modes 
	and check if they are useful and well-implemented.

2001-01-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* HACKING: added notice about autogenerated files.

2001-01-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpcolorarea.[ch]: added a new simple widget which
	provides a color preview area capable of DND. It will be used 
	in the GimpColorButton and in the color_selectors.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpui.h
	* libgimp/gimpuitypes.h: include the new files

2001-01-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.[ch]
	* app/color_select.c: moved the scales and the toggle butttons out
	of the notebook. Added an "Aplha" scale (the opacity is not yet
	shown in the color area). Removed the ColorNotebook structure from
	the header.

	* app/color_area.c: the ColorNotebook struct is no longer public.

	* libgimp/gimpcolorselector.h
	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c
	* modules/colorsel_water.c: changed the ColorSelector module
	interface again: Pass H, S, V, R, G, B and A in all functions
	and callbacks. Added a "set_channel" method because the channel
	toggles are outside the notebook now. This needs more work...

2001-01-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.[ch]
	* app/color_select.c: moved the "old" and "new" color areas from the

	at all.

2001-01-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.c
	* app/color_select.c
	* libgimp/gimpcolorselector.h: more cleanup before chopping it up.

	* app/colormap_dialog.i.[ch]
	* app/colormap_dialog.p.h
	* app/colormap_dialog.t.h
	* app/gimp.gh
	* tools/gcg/*: removed.

	here and cleaned up the autogenerated code.

	* autogen.sh
	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/color_notebook.h
	* app/commands.c
	* app/gimpset.h
	* app/interface.c
	* po/POTFILES.in
	* tools/Makefile.am: changed accordingly, cleanup.

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: s/class/klass/

2001-01-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpcolorselector.h

	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c
	* modules/colorsel_water.c: made the color_notebook, the color_area
	and DND speak in terms of RGBA instead of RGB. The alpha value is
	not used yet, only the API changed. Everything should work exactly
	as before.

2001-01-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml: add "Cleanup GIMP's color selectors".

2001-01-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/bezier_selectP.h: removed the obscure unused "extend" variable
	from the Bezier Tool structure.

2001-01-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml: added an item to optionally change the image window's
	background.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: "Disable Tearoff Menus" was not saved
	to disk.

2001-01-04  Asbjorn Pettersen  <asbjornP@dualog.no>

	* modules/gimpmodregister.h: add #include <libgimp/gimptypes.h>
	* plug-ins/common/bz2.c (load_image): fix bug loading bz2 files (OS/2)

2001-01-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/title-header.scm: merged fix from 1.2

2001-01-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/levels.c: reverted the behaviour of the "Reset" button back
	to resetting the current channel only. Resetting all channels was
	broken and IMHO cannot work the way it was implemented.

2001-01-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in_cmds.c
	* app/procedural_db_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/procedural_db.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: conditionally include <regex.h> or

2001-01-03  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* app/plug_in_cmds.c:
	* app/procedural_db_cmds.c:
	* plug-ins/script-fu/Makefile.am:
	* plug-ins/script-fu/interp_regex.c:
	* plug-ins/script-fu/regexrepl.c: Conditionally compile
	regex if not available in glibc.
	
	* plug-ins/script-fu/regex.c:
	* plug-ins/script-fu/regex.h: Renamed files to regexrepl.[ch].

2001-01-03  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* configure.in: Extended the glibc regexp check and enabled
	substitution for Makefiles.
	
	* app/Makefile.am: Compile regexp only if not in glibc.
	
	* app/plug_in_cmds.c: 
	* app/procedural_db_cmds.c:
	* app/regexrepl.c: Include the correct local headerfile 
	if no new glibc with regexp is available.
	
	* app/regex.c:
	* app/regex.h: Moved into regexprepl.[ch] to avoid nameclashes. 

2001-01-02  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* acconfig.h:
	* configure.in: Added a check for a glibc compliant
	regex implementation.

2001-01-02  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_core.c: use floor() before casting to gint when 
	calculating the current brush coordinates. Fixes the jagged brush 
	stroke when stroking a path that leaves the image at the top or left
	edge (bug #6043).
	
2001-01-02  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* app/clone.c:
	* app/gimpimage.c:
	* app/temp_buf.c: Use the new _clear function and more cleanups.

2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/temp_buf.[ch]: temp_buf_data_clear(): the temp_buf's size is
	(width * height * bytes). Cleanups.

	* app/fileops.c: removed a debugging g_print().

2001-01-02  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* app/temp_buf.c:
	* app/temp_buf.h: Add a new function "temp_buf_data_clear" to
	get a nulled chunk of memory.
	
	* app/iscissors.c: Use it here instead of two expensive for
	loops. Clean up the source a little.

2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/bezier_selectP.h
	* app/selection_options.h: moved the integer "extend" variable from
	SelectionOptions to the BezierSelect structure because it does not
	have a UI widget. Also initialize it with "0" (was used
	uninitialized before). I have no idea what it does.

2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/selection_options.h
	* app/tool_options.c: made a correct tool toption out of
	"Interactive" (added a default value and the "Reset" function,
	set unused pointers to NULL).

	* app/iscissors.c: fixed indentation and spacing.

2001-01-02  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* app/iscissors.c:
	* app/selection_options.h:
	* app/tool_options.c: Applied patch by laramieleavitt@onetel.net.uk
	to add an interactive update to the iscissors tool.

2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimphelp.c (gimp_idle_help): s/welcome.html/introduction.html/.

2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.[ch]
	* app/menus.[ch]
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: added a preferences option to disable
	tearoff menus. Cleanup in preferences.

	* TODO.xml: done.

2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c: some nicer prototypes.

	* app/fileops.c: oops, forgot to gtk_widget_show() the open_options.

2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/fileops.[ch]
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/menus.c: Implemented "Save a Copy as..." which saves the image
	without changing it's filename.

	* app/layers_dialogP.h: export layers_dialog_layer_merge_query()
	here instead of defining it in commands.c

	* TODO.xml: mark this entry as done :)

2001-01-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml: added a TODO item for "Save a Copy..."

2001-01-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gck.h
	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gckcolor.c: removed the GckRGB color type
	and all it's functions.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpcolor.[ch]: new files containing the new GimpRGB color
	type and assorted functions.

	* libgimp/gimpcolorspace.[ch]: colorspace conversion routines for
	the new GimpRGB type. Also taken from LibGCK.

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimptypes.h: #include "gimpcolor.h". It's ugly to include
	it in both files but unavoidable to follow our new "*.c" file include
	policy. This will go away as libgimp will be chopped up into pieces
	anyway.

	* app/apptypes.h
	* app/asupsample.[ch]
	* app/blend.c
	* app/color_transfer.h
	* app/gradient_header.h: removed "color_t" and use GimpRGB instead.

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_shade.h
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: s/GckRGB/GimpRGB/g

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/gdyntextcompat.h: check also for GIMP's minor
	version when deciding if to add a missing PDB wrapper.
	(All this compat cruft including libgimp/gimpcompat.h should go
	away ASAP)

2000-12-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	More preparation for LibGCK removal:

	* libgimp/gimpcolorspace.[ch]: added a "_int" suffix to all functions
	operating on 3 gint pointers, just like the gdouble functions have
	a "_double" suffix.

	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/hue_saturation.c
	* app/paint_funcs.c
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c
	* plug-ins/common/CML_explorer.c
	* plug-ins/common/scatter_hsv.c
	* plug-ins/common/sparkle.c
	* plug-ins/common/vinvert.c
	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c: changed accordingly.

2000-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
            Simon Budig <simon@gimp.org>
	
	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* plug-ins/common/gih.c: explicitely cast offset to (off_t) when 
	seeking back. Should fix the problems reading grayscale BrushPipes 
	on IRIX.

2000-12-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/apptypes.h: cleaned up a bit.

	* app/asupsample.[ch]

2000-12-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	One more 17C3 commit ...

2000-12-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage.[ch]: removed all the
	"typedef gimage_function gimp_image_function" stuff so we can clearly
	see what is really a GImage function.
	Removed gimage_get_ID(). Use pdb_id_to_image() instead.

2000-12-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml: more things to do

2000-12-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/channel_pvt.h
	* app/drawable_pvt.h
	* app/gdisplayF.h
	* app/gimpdrawableP.h
	* app/gimpimageP.h
	* app/layer_pvt.h
	* app/toolsF.h: removed these files.

	* app/apptypes.h
	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: added tons of opaque typedefs and enums.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brush_select.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brushes.pdb

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/patterns.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/selection.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb
	* app/*: chainsaw #include cleanup:

	- Never (never!!) include stuff in header files except where we
	  need access to structures' contents (like derived objects).
	- Added prototypes and proper formating in many files.
	- The #include order in *all* *.c files is as follows:

	#include "config.h"

	#include <system stuff>

	#include <gtk/gtk.h>

	#include "apptypes.h"

	#include "gimp stuff"

	#include "libgimp stuff"

	#include "libgimp/gimpintl.h"

	By following this scheme we can easily see a file's dependencies
	from it's #include's and can grep for the inclusion to find out
	where a file is used.

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: changed to follow the include scheme above.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpuitypes.h: new file, included from libgimp/gimpui.h
	and from app/apptypes.h.

	* libgimp/gimpcolorbutton.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpdialog.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimphelpui.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpparasite.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.[ch]

	* libgimp/gimpui.h
	* libgimp/gimpunit.h
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpwidgets.[ch]: changed accordingly.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.c
	* plug-ins/gdyntext/message_window.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_default_dialog.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_file.c: these files used to include
	"libgimp/gimpui.h" without including "libgimp/gimp.h". This is
	no longer possible because the libgimpui headers don't include
	"libgimp/gimpunit.h" any more.

2000-12-29  Asbjorn Pettersen  <asbjornP@dualog.no>

	* app/module_db.c: OS/2 fix. remove gimp_color_display_register(),,

2000-12-29  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c   Fixed the same 16->8bit conversion
	bug as in gimp-1-2 and removed duplicated code.

2000-12-28  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* gimp_splash.ppm     A new splash...
	* gimp1_2_splash.ppm  A new file for the old splash

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c   Fixed a warning.
	
2000-12-28  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c
	Cleanup, indentation madness, first steps towards a one-click
	color-selector.
	
2000-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.c
	* app/layer.c: use gtk_object_sink() instead of gtk_object_unref()
	when deleting a layer or channel since only floating objects should
	be destroyed this way. A layer or channel that has been attached
	to an image shall never be deleted.
	
	* app/layer_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimplayer_pdb.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: reenabled the gimp_layer_delete() PDB
	function since it might be useful under rare circumstances.
	
2000-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layer_select.[ch]: small new feature: display a layer preview
	popup when switching the active layer using PageUp/PageDown. Could
	need a little tweaking...
	
2000-12-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.[ch]
	* app/drawable.h
	* app/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* app/gimpdrawableP.h
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]
	* app/gimpimageP.h
	* app/layer.[ch]
	* app/layer_pvt.h: started a major cleanup of all image/drawable
	files. Added tons of "const GimpImage *" declarations and properly
	formated the headers.

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/fileops.[ch]
	* app/fuzzy_select.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/move.c
	* app/paint_funcs.[ch]
	* app/qmask.c
	* app/undo.c: changed accordingly plus the usual portion of coding
	style paranoia. This is not finished but Sven promised to buy me
	a beer if I commit now ;)

2000-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/boundaryF.h
	* app/gdisplayP.h
	* app/gimplistP.h
	* app/gimplutP.h
	* app/gimpsetP.h
	* app/parasitelistP.h

	* app/gimplut.[ch]
	* app/gimpset.[ch]
	* app/parasitelist.[ch]
	* app/pixel_processor.c
	* app/pixel_region.[ch]: moved structure definitions into the
	normal headers, various cleanups

2000-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/perl/examples/bricks
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/glowing_steel
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/channel.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb:

	Two of the gimp-perl scripts used to call gimp_layer_delete() after
	gimp_image_remove_layer(). This will fail since the layer is already 
	scheduled for destruction by removing it from the associated image or
	by deleting that image. It is thus dangerous and superfluous to export
	this feature through the PDB. The gimp_layer_delete() is hereby
	obsolete and does nothing any longer. I have removed the code calling
	it from all over the place (it was commented out in almost all places).

	The PDB help for gimp_channel_delete() now explicetly tells the user 
	about the proper usage of the procedure.
	
2000-12-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.[ch]
	* app/bezier_selectP.h: massive cleanup (prototypes, indentation, ...)

2000-12-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: cleanup, proper prototypes, ...

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: the size of the string holding the
	image data was one byte too short (we forgot the trailing '\0').
	Reported by <goswin.brederlow@student.uni-tuebingen.de>

2000-12-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* TODO.xml
	* docs/make-todo: new files. TODO.xml is a first start on a roadmap
	towards gimp-1.4. All new features and major changes need to be 
	defined here to be accepted into the gimp-1.3 branch.

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: gimp_image_merge_layers(): apply the layer mask
	only if layer->apply_mask is TRUE, cleanup.

	* plug-ins/mosaic/mosaic.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/textured-logo.scm
	Implemented a toggle to ask the user, if he wants to allow some
	tiles to be split in two pieces. This enables perfect hexagonal/
	squared/octagonal tiles. Changed the PDB-Interface and changed the
	script using this plug-in.

	* app/gimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: implemented gimp_image_get_layer_by_index(),
	small cleanups.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: use the new function instead of accessing
	the layer list directly.

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: layers_dialog_scroll_index(): don't fiddle
	around with magic numbers when calculating the layer widget's
	height but simply ask one of them for it's allocation.  Fixes
	positioning when the preview is smaller than the layer widget list
	item.
