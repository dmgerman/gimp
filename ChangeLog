Wed May  5 18:18:16 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * configure.in: enabled _NOUI versions of GIMP_CFLAGS and
        GIMP_LIBS.

Wed May  5 14:29:51 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/datafiles.c: Add <sys/types.h>.
	* app/patterns.c: <sys/types.h> before <dirent.h>

Wed May  5 12:40:54 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* app/cursorutil.c: Moved the cursors out of 'pixmaps' into a new
	directory 'cursors'. Added the files to the Makefile.
	Now its up to TigerT to provide a set of rocking cursors for us ;-)

1999-05-05  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* pixmaps/mouse1*: new bitmap files containing the new mouse cursors.

	* app/parasitelist.c: use g_str_equal instead of parasite_compare_func.

	* app/paint_core.c: interpret perfectmouse right way round.

	* app/rect_select{P,}.[ch]: set custom cursors when the operation type
 	changes.  Centralize the calculation of op based on the modifier
 	keys being held.

	* app/fuzzy_select.c, app/free_select.c: allow the rect_select
 	functions calculate the operation type.

	* app/ellipse_select.c: use the SelectionOps typedefs.

	* app/edit_selection.c: convert MaskToLayerTranslate into
 	FloatingSelTranslate if there is already a floating selection in
 	init_edit_selection.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: fixed the calculation of state.

	* app/gdisplay.[ch], app/cursorutil.[ch]: new functions to allow
 	the loading of customized cursors.

	* app/paint_funcs.[ch], app/channel.c: border_region now accepts
 	seperate xradius and yradius arguments.

Tue May  4 15:51:16 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: use the sinclude bit again, since it works in
	automake 1.4. Generate the Makefile in the embed dir too

	* app/gimp.sym: new file, list the symbols we want export to 
	modules here

	* app/Makefile.am: add -export-symbols to LDFLAGS

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: use make variable expansion instead of
	direct substitution for optional plug-in dirs. E.g., now one can
	do "make GIMP_PERL=" to skip the perl plug-in dir during build
	without rerunning configure

	* plug-ins/rcm/Makefile.am: add header files to SOURCES

Tue May  4 15:16:47 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool.c: s@gdkprivate@gdk/gdkprivate@

1999-05-04  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	Win32 portability changes:

	* config.h.win32, README.win32: Small changes.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/*.pdb: Include <string.h>.

	* app/*_cmds.c: Autogenerated files reflect above changes.

	* libgimp/makefile.msc app/makefile.msc: Various updates,
 	including new object files. Gtk+ directory now should be called
 	gtk+ (not gtk-plus). Use win32-specific gdk subdir. Glib directory
 	now should be called just glib.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Updates.

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.win32: Made current with
 	gimpfeatures.h.in.

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c: Define S_ISDIR and S_ISREG if
 	necessary.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: Must have a
 	statement (even an empty one) after a label.

	* app/fileops_cmds.c: Autogenerated file reflects above changes.

	* app/crop.c: Include <string.h>.

	* app/{app_procs,batch,fileops,datafiles,errorconsole,general,
 	plug_in,temp_buf,tile_swap}.c: Test NATIVE_WIN32, not
 	_MSC_VER. (NATIVE_WIN32 means we are using the Microsoft C
 	runtime, even if we might be compiling with gcc.)

	* app/fileops.c: Don't include <process.h> here.

	* app/fileops.h: Do include <process.h> here.

	* app/gimpparasite.c: Include config.h, guard inclusion of
 	<unistd.h>. (Is the inclusion of unistd.h in source files all over
 	the place really necessary?)

	* app/ink.c: MSC doesn't handle conversion from unsigned __int64
 	to double, so cast to signed.

	* app/lut_funcs.c: Include config.h, and define rint() if necessary.

	* app/pixel_processor.c: Include config.h without "..", like in
 	all the other places. Include <string.h>

	* app/text_tool.c: Guard the "POINTS" identifier that clashes with
 	<windows.h>, sigh.

1999-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/commands.c: call gdisplays_resize_cursor_label(gimage)
	after changing the image's unit.

	* app/gdisplay.c: update the cursor label after resizing it's
	frame, so the old (wrong) value gets overwritten.

	* app/resize.c: it makes more sense to take the image's unit from
	the "print size" frame rather than from "pixel dimensions".
	Set reasonable boundaries to avoid over/underflows with crazy
	resolutions. Code and gui cleanup.
	The constants for min/max image size/resolution should probably go
	to a central place.

	* app/text_tool.c: set the resolution in the X font spec only if
	the size is specified in points (reported by Austin).

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: fixed a bad bug in the boundary and
	resolution setting code (was not noticable before the new
	resize/scale ui).

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/*: version 1.4.3

	* plug-ins/png/png.c: gcc suggested parentheses.

Mon May  3 15:38:54 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.5 release

Mon May  3 15:34:37 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb: progress_init takes an int32, not
	a display...

>>>>>>> 1.1075
Mon May  3 14:03:35 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimage.pdb: fix rotten regexp eval
	
Mon May  3 21:44:27 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/palette.c: put up messages telling user about corrupted
 	    palette files as we load them.  In particular, try and catch
 	    MSDOS format files such as those distributed from Visibone's
 	    website.

Mon May  3 21:30:46 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: changed order of cflags and library path in
        GIMP_CLFAGS and GIMP_LIBS.

Mon May  3 12:04:47 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/plug_in.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/interface.pdb: new files

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: add no_id_lookup option

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: added new pdb files, plug_in.h

	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: plug_in.h enums

	* app/plug_in.[ch]: removed PDB stuff, exported current_plug_in,
	proc_defs, and plug_in_progress_{init,update}

	* app/interface_cmds.c
	* app/plug_in_cmds.c
	* app/internal_procs.c: pdbgenned files

	* app/Makefile.am: new files: interface_cmds.c, plug_in_cmds.c

Sun May  2 14:56:52 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.h: guide types used to start at 1, so make them
	start at 1

	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl
	* app/guides_cmds.c: autogenned files reflect above change

1999-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/resize.[ch]: new scale/resize ui:
	Use size entries instead of text entries, chainbuttons instead of
	check buttons. Put the stuff into frames. Added labels for the
	original width and height.
	It's possible to change resolution/unit now, please test if it
	does the right thing.

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: allow lower == upper when checking
	boundaries.

Sat May  1 14:43:42 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb
	* app/fileops_cmds.c: fixed dumbass save code

Sat May  1 22:18:55 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/brush_select.h
	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.h: delay the popup of pattern and brush
 	    preview window by 150 millisecs.  Allows flicker-free
 	    selection of brushes/patterns, and still have fast pattern
 	    preview like we used to.  Ideally, should really factor out
 	    the common code in these two files into one generic picker
 	    widget.

	* app/free_select.c: cosmetic whitespace change.

	* app/draw_core.c: use GDK_CAP_NOT_LAST, not GDK_CAP_BUTT,
 	    otherwise sequential line segments in XOR mode have
 	    single-pixel gaps between them.  Worse, if the segments are
 	    only one pixel long, you don't get _any_ lines.  XFree86 seems
 	    to ignore GDK_CAP_BUTT, which is why this bug hasn't been seen
 	    before.  NCD X servers comply with the spec a little more
 	    pedantically, so need GDK_CAP_NOT_LAST.  OS/2 and Win32 people
 	    should check that (eg) the lasso tool still provides proper
 	    visual feedback.

Sat May  1 12:14:54 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acinclude.m4
	* config.guess
	* config.sub
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: upgrade to libtool 1.3

	* Makefile.am: don't install gimprc.5 in our sharedir

Sat May  1 11:05:02 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/print/print.c (get_printers): OS/2 printing.
	* plug-ins/print/print-ps.c (ps_print): set prn in text mode.
	* plug-ins/ps/ps.c (read_pnmraw_type): skip '\r';
	* plug-ins/screenshot/screenshot.c (shoot): Use spawnlp() instead of
 	fork().

	* plug-ins/hrz/hrz.c (load_image): Use g_malloc instead of mmap
	for OS/2.

Fri Apr 30 17:01:01 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

        * app/module_db.c (mod_load): only OS/2 patches.

Fri Apr 30 13:31:14 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: listed tools first in SUBDIRS, so xgettext can grab
	the autogenned files

	* acconfig.h: removed unused HAVE_XSHM_H

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: added proc invoke method, nicer header
	formatting

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: use layer_mask type for return value
	for layer_create_mask

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/misc.pdb: added quit proc

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: added ink proc, but not added to @procs
	since it's incomplete

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: new file

	* app/Makefile.am: added fileops_cmds.c

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/ink.c: removed PDB procs (the one in ink.c was incomplete)

	* app/fileops.h: exported load_procs, save_procs, and file_proc_find()

	* app/plug_in.h: exported enum, #include <sys/types.h>

	* app/fileops_cmds.c
	* app/layer_cmds.c
	* app/misc_cmds.c
	* app/parasite_cmds.c
	* app/patterns_cmds.c
	* app/procedural_db_cmds.c
	* app/text_tool_cmds.c
	* app/internal_procs.c: pdbgen updates

	* app/paint_funcs.c: the glibc 2.1 docs say using SVID threadsafe
	random functions are preferable to rand_r, so use them instead of
	a mutex

1999-04-30  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/*: updated version 1.4.2

1999-04-30  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/flip_tool.c: fixed a cut-and-paste bug: vertical flip
	iterates over rows, not columns.

Thu Apr 29 16:32:11 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/url/url.c (load_image): 
	* plug-ins/webbrowser/webbrowser.c (start_browser): 
	Use spawnlp() instead of fork().

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c : OS/2 patches.
 	use G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR_S instead of ":", add sys/types.h,,.

1999-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select.[ch]: disabled setting the size of the
	brushes dialog again because it still caused SIGFPE's in some rare
	cases. I'm trying to fix that.
	*Minimal* ui spacing changes. Some changes to make the code look
	more similar (I'm a make-them-look-the-same fanatic ;)

Wed Apr 28 20:53:18 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/ops_buttons.c
	* app/tool_options.c: some code cleanup and i18n fixes

Wed Apr 28 16:28:08 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/gimprc.c: Add <sys/types.h>, Open text files with "rt".
	Add OS/2 function  add_x11root_token (char *x11root).

	* app/install.c (install_run): Add install for OS/2.

Tue Apr 27 23:52:26 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* tools/Makefile.am
	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: integrated pdbgen into the build system

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: renamed gimp_image_findnext_guide to
	gimp_image_find_next_guide, so change pdb wrapper

	* plug-ins/guillotine/guillotine.c: reflect api change

Tue Apr 27 22:59:08 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tool_options.c
	* app/tool_options_ui.h: redid the tool_options_radio_buttons_new
	function I introduced yesterday

	* app/interface.c: had to add GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK to the 
	events the window catches. Hopefully this doesn't break anything.

	* app/tools.c
	* app/tools.h
	* app/toolsF.h: decided that it makes more sense to have a 
	modifier_key_func instead of a toggle_key_func. That way we can
	catch all modifiers. Now if someone knows how to handle non-GDK 
	cursors, please implement context-cursors for the selection tools.

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/flip_tool.c: adapted to use the new modifier_key_func

	* all other tools: changed to use standard_modifier_key_func

	* app/internal_procs.[ch]: finally pdbgenned

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: ChannelType, MergeType enum changes

	* app/commands.c: remove gimage_cmds.h #include

	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.[ch]
	* app/flip_tool.[ch]: Made these tools toggleable.

	* all other tools: added a standard_toggle_key_func.
	
Mon Apr 26 16:05:55 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: 
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c: 
	MAIN macro at the end of file.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c: 
	* plug-ins/CML_explorer/CML_explorer.c: Add <sys/types.h>.

Sun Apr 25 21:25:23 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c:  Add <sys/types.h>.
	 Use G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR_S instead of ":".

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c: Add <sys/types.h>

Sun Apr 25 16:59:09 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	as a persistant parasite if the comment was edited.

1999-04-25  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/text_tool.c: added resolution support if the tool is used
	from the interface. Can't do this for the PDB because the text has
	to be rendered in the size "text_get_extents" (which currently has
	no access to resolution information) returns.

Sat Apr 24 18:36:04 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_mask_cmds.[ch]: pdbgenned, use header file

	* app/internal_procs.c: use pdbgen register for gimage mask funcs

	* app/Makefile.am: remove gimage_mask_cmds.h

Sat Apr 24 21:50:58 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/edit_selection.c: Finished the opaque-move stuff...
	hopefully.  Float and selection-mask movement behaviour
	repaired, etc.

	* libgimp/gimp.c (set_gimp_PLUG_IN_INFO): Set the PLUG_IN_INFO
	structure in a normal way (at run-time). 
	The UNIX PLUG_IN_INFO is set at linking time!

	The read/writechannel is set in BINARY mode (OS/2 version). 

	* libgimp/gimp.h (MAIN): Add MAIN macro for OS/2 plugins.

1999-04-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/bucket_fill.c: added a "BG Color Fill" radio button.
	Toggling FG/BG with <shift> works in both color fill modes now.

	* app/brush_select.c: session management sets the size of the
	dialog again (depending on the current paint options mode because
	bad things happen if the brush preview's size is reduced beyond
	it's minimum).

Thu Apr 22 22:14:02 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdrawable.c: gave parasite undo a MISC_UNDO class for now
	so it compiles

	* app/tools_cmds.c: fix crop invoker to give correct args to 
	crop_image

	* app/color_cmds.c: s/GRAY/GRAY_LUT/g;

	function from gimage_cmds to channel_ops, export offset and duplicate

	* app/gimpbrushlist.[ch]: removed PDB procs

	* app/gradient.[ch]: removed PDB procs,

	* app/gradient_header.h: exported G_SAMPLE, GradSelect, num_gradients,
	grad_active_dialogs, gradient_select_dialog

	* app/gradient_select.c: removed PDB procs,
	s/active_dialogs/grad_active_dialogs/

	* app/patterns.[ch]: removed PDB procs

	* app/procedrual_db.h: fiddled with enums

	* app/channel_cmds.[ch]
	* app/drawable_cmds.[ch]
	* app/parasite_cmds.[ch]: pdbgenned now, removed header files

	* app/brush_select_cmds.c
	* app/gradient_cmds.c
	* app/gradient_select_cmds.c
	* app/patterns_cmds.c
	* app/pattern_select_cmds.c

	* app/patterns.c: 
	* app/palette_select.c: 
	* app/palette.c: 
	* app/general.c: 
	* app/errorconsole.c: Add <sys/types.h>

1999-04-23  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select.[ch]: made the previews change their size in
	sync with resizing the dialog. The previews auto-resize with their
	parent frame now. Connect to the preview's "size_allocate" signal,
	not to the frame's, don't "signal_connect_after". Get the size of
	the preview from it's allocation and not from it's requisition.
	There's no need to remember width, height and the frame in the
	structures anymore, so I kicked them out. Tweaked the code to look
	more similar.

Fri Apr 23 08:31:50 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: <sys/types.h> before <sys/stat.h>

	* plug-ins/lic/lic.c: MAIN at the end of file.
	* plug-ins/despeckle/despeckle.c: 
	* plug-ins/destripe/destripe.c: 
	* plug-ins/png/png.c: 
	* plug-ins/sgi/sgi.c:  Use MAIN() macro.

1999-04-22  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/edit_selection.c: removed some nonfunctional code.

	* app/paintbrush.c: when ctl (or alt) is held set the fg (or bg) color.

	* app/gimpparasite.[ch]: made char *name parameters const.

	* app/parasitelist.c: removed unused static variable.

	* app/gimpdrawable.c, app/gimpimage.c, app/undo.[ch]: added
 	support for undoing parasite changes.

	* libgimp/gimp.h, libgimp/gimpimage.c: added
 	gimp_undo_push_group_start and gimp_undo_push_group_end

	* libgimp/parasite.[ch]: added undoable flag.

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/font_selection.c: fixed c++ style comment.

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/gdyntext.c: use the new undoable parasites.

	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_misc.c: arctg can't be inline because it is
 	used in other .c files

	* plug-ins/waterselect/waterselect.c,
	* plug-ins/rotators/rotators.c, app/tips_dialog.c, app/plug_in.c:
 	fixed some warnings

Fri Apr 23 01:31:29 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: autocrop used to miss the bottom line
	* plug-ins/autocrop/autocrop.c: same fix here

1999-04-22  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	First version of per-tool paint options. No PDB interface yet.
	The tool options dialog got rather big when in per-tool mode, so
	it will probably have to become a notebook.

	It's not yet 100% consistent. If switched off, everything should
	behave exactly like before.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/paint_options.h: new file

	* app/tool_options.c: PaintOptions gui. Maintain a list of all
	paint tools' ToolOptions to enable switching between global and
	per-tool paint options.

	* app/brush_select.[ch]: changed packing boxes, tables, ...
	The paint options in the brush selection can be hidden now.
	Moved create_paint_mode_menu() to paint_options.h and
	tool_options.c and renamed it to paint_mode_menu_new().

	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/gimpbrush.[ch]
	* app/gimpbrushlist.[ch]
	* app/paint_core.c: moved gimp_brush_[set|get]_spacing() from
	gimpbrushlist.[ch] to gimpbrush.[ch].
	Moved gimp_brush_[get|set]_[opacity|paint_mode]() to
	paint_options.h and tool_options.c and renamed them to
	paint_options_*_*().  They are "global paint options" now.

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/eraser.c
	* app/ink.c
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/pencil.c: all paint tools' options are derived from
	"PaintOptions" now. Opacity and paint mode are obtained through
	macros which take into account the current paint options mode.

	* app/buildmenu.h: #include <gtk/gtk.h>

	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/text_tool.c: changed spacings.

	* app/gimprc.[ch]: new gimprc option "global-paint-options"

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Added a "Tool Options" page. Code
	cleanup. Some work on the convenience constructors test site.

	* app/tools.c: fixed "unused variable" warning.

Thu Apr 22 16:05:10 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

Wed Apr 21 00:36:03 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: only add file to the 'recently opened' list if
	    it's not there already.

Tue Apr 20 21:53:01 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_cmds.c: moved a bunch of PDB stuff here

	* app/color_balance.[ch]: removed PDB proc, exported TransferMode
	enum, ColorBalanceDialog, color_balance_create_lookup_tables, and
	color_balance

	* app/curves.[ch]: removed PDB procs, exported SMOOTH and GFREE
	#defines, CurvesDialog, curves_lut_func and curves_calculate_curve

	* app/desaturate.[ch]: removed PDB proc, exported desaturate

	* app/equalize.[ch]: removed PDB proc, exported equalize

	* app/crop.c: optimized the autocrop algorithm

Tue Apr 20 23:38:26 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c: add the new args to gimp-paintbrush PDB
	    calls.

	* app/blend.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/invert.c: check return from procedural_db_run_proc() rather
	    than dereferencing NULL.

	* app/paintbrush.c: plumb the non-gui fade_out option into the
	    functions that actually do the work, rather than using
	    an uninitialised value.

	* app/procedural_db.c: better error messages on PDB typecheck fail
	    in procedural_db_run_proc.  Also now valid to
	    procedural_db_destroy_args() on a NULL pointer.
	* app/procedural_db.h: pdb_type_name() function added, plus
	    comment urging people to keep the enum and strings in step.

	* configure.in: bump minimum perl version from 5.004 to 5.004_4.

Mon Apr 19 23:31:17 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap: Changes to the GAP plug-in as they were sent to
	me by Wolfgang Hofer.

1999-04-19  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/penstroke.xpm: Punched a hole inside the icon - it 
	shouldnt be filled I guess..

	* pixmaps/yes.xpm, pixmaps/no.xpm: Changed the icons (X and V) 
	to the ones that are also used in gnome - we can look more
	consistent this way  :)

1999-04-19  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* plug-ins/png/png.c: applied gimp-ruth-990413-0.patch. Modified
	it to leave the image's unit untouched because png has only
	resolution and no unit info. Fixed some unrelated warnings.

Sun Apr 18 14:19:36 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/tools_cmds.c: new file, containes the PDB stuff for most
	of the tools

	* app/shear_tool.[ch]: bye bye PDB stuff (exported necessary enums
	functions, vars, etc.)

	* app/internal_procs.c: use register_foo functions

	* app/blend.[ch]: GradientType enum case changed

	more consistent

	* app/clone.[ch]: capitalized the CloneType enum

	* app/color_picker.[ch]: changed get_color to pick_color so we don't
	conflict with colormaps.c get_color

	* app/convolve.[ch]: capitalized the ConvolveType enum

	* app/paint_core.h: made a GradientPaintMode enum

	* app/transform_core.h: BoundingBox enum

	* app/scale_tool.c: use the generic bounding box enum for X1, Y1, etc.

	* app/shear_tool.[ch]: turned HORZ and VERT into a ShearType enum

1999-04-18  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
    
	* app/internal_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/gimprc.c: wrote a function to save arbitrary "token" "value"
	pairs in the user gimprc and added gimprc_set to the PDB.

1999-04-18  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/paintbrush.c: fixed a sensitive setting bug I introduced
	with the last change.

	* app/text_tool.c: added a toggle button which enables calling
	gDynText.

	* app/tool_options.c: the toggle callback does some more sensitive
	settings.

1999-04-18  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/ink.c
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/transform_tool.c: remember all radio buttons in the
	ToolOptions structures. This enables arbitrary default values and
	gui feedback for the "toggle key" feature.

Sat Apr 17 11:15:35 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool_cmds.c: doh, decipoints not decipixels

Thu Apr 15 23:04:17 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/color_picker.c

	Must account for layer offsets.

Thu Apr 15 14:41:01 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* applied gimp-lecorfec-99041[02]-0, changes follow

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.h (make_color_map):
	replaced free with g_free to fix segfault.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_preview.c (compute_preview):
	allocate xpostab and ypostab only when needed (it could also be
	allocated on stack with a compilation-fixed size like MapObject).
	It avoids to lose some Kb on each preview :)
	Also reindented (unfortunate C-c C-q) some other lines.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c (run):
	release allocated postabs.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c:
	callbacks now have only one argument because gck widget use
	gtk_signal_connect_object. Caused segfault for scale widget.

	* plug-ins/autocrop/autocrop.c (doit):
	return if image has only background (thus fixing a segfault).

	* plug-ins/emboss/emboss.c (pluginCore, emboss_do_preview):
	replaced malloc/free with g_malloc/g_free (unneeded, but
	shouldn't everyone use glib calls ? :)

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c :
	replaced a segfaulting free, and several harmless malloc/free pairs.

	* plug-ins/flame/megawidget.c (mw_preview_build):
	replaced harmless malloc/free pair.
	Note : mwp->bits is malloc'ed but seems to be never freed.

	* plug-ins/fractaltrace/fractaltrace.c (pixels_free):
	replaced a bunch of segfaulting free.
	(pixels_get, dialog_show): replaced gtk_signal_connect_object
	with gtk_signal_connect to accomodate callbacks (caused STRANGE
	dialog behaviour, coz you destroyed buttons one by one).

	* plug-ins/illusion/illusion.c (dialog):
	same gtk_signal_connect_object replacement for same reasons.

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gckcolor.c :
	changed all gck_rgb_to_color* functions to use a static GdkColor
	instead of a malloc'ed area. Provided reentrant functions with
	the old behaviour (gck_rgb_to_color*_r). Made some private functions
	static, too.
	gck_rgb_to_gdkcolor now use the new functions while
	gck_rgb_to_gdkcolor_r is the reentrant version.
	Also affected by this change: gck_gc_set_foreground and
	gck_gc_set_background (no more free(color)).

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gckcolor.h :
	added the gck_rgb_to_gdkcolor_r proto.

	* plug-ins/lic/lic.c (ok_button_clicked, cancel_button_clicked) :
	segfault on gtk_widget_destroy, now calls gtk_main_quit.
	(dialog_destroy) : segfault on window closure when called by
	"destroy" event. Now called by "delete_event".

	* plug-ins/megawidget/megawidget.c (mw_preview_build):
	replaced harmless malloc/free pair.
	Note : mwp->bits is malloc'ed but seems to be never freed.

	* plug-ins/png/png.c (load_image):
	replaced 2 segfaulting free.

	* plug-ins/print/print-ps.c (ps_print):
	replaced a segfaulting free (called many times :).

	* plug-ins/sgi/sgi.c (load_image, save_image):
	replaced a bunch of segfaulting free, and did some harmless
	inits to avoid a few gcc warnings.

	* plug-ins/wind/wind.c (render_wind):
	replaced a segfaulting free.
	(render_blast): replaced harmless malloc/free pair.

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c (ReadImage):
	yet another free()/g_free() problem fixed.

	* plug-ins/exchange/exchange.c (real_exchange):
	ditto.

	* plug-ins/fp/fp.h: added Frames_Check_Button_In_A_Box proto.
	* plug-ins/fp/fp_gtk.c: closing subdialogs via window manager
	wasn't handled, thus leading to errors and crashes.
	Now delete_event signals the dialog control button
	to close a dialog with the good way.

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c (value_pair_create):
	tried to set events mask on scale widget (a NO_WINDOW widget).

	* plug-ins/png/png.c (save_image):
	Replaced 2 free() with g_free() for g_malloc'ed memory.
	Mysteriously I corrected the loading bug but not the saving one :)

Thu Apr 15 14:08:51 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/gdyntext: new plugin

Thu Apr 15 21:20:45 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/color_picker.c

	Added UI feedback to the tool when using the sample average
	option. 
	Fixed the scale of the sample area to be integral (is this right?).

Thu Apr 15 12:14:30 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: fixed an off-by-one error and renamed the tool
	to "Resize & Crop"
	* app/tools.c: reflect the name change 

Thu Apr 15 01:32:58 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: The autocrop mechanism now first checks if there's
	transparency to crop. If there are no transparent borders it
	tries to crop uniformly colored areas from the borders.

Wed Apr 14 14:27:51 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/app_procs.c, app/module_db.[ch]: call module_unload 
	functions on all modules when we quit (don't close it, though).

Wed Apr 14 00:27:53 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* Makefile.am

	Added new pixmap file to Makefile.am EXTRA_DIST

Tue Apr 13 22:17:23 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/bezier_select.c 
	* app/bezier_select.h 
	* app/pathsP.h 
	* app/paths_dialog.c 
	* app/transform_core.c 
	* app/transform_core.h 
	* app/undo.c 	

	New:-

	* pixmap/locked.xpm

	New image. (Your welcome to improve upon it...)

	Paths can now be locked down for transformations. Click next to the
	paths preview and a icon will appear. This path will "locked" during
	transformations (via the transforms tool). Undo for these path 
	transformations is also available.

	Fixed bug when creating a path for the first time when no paths dialog
	visible.	

Tue Apr 13 00:01:24 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped up to 1.1.5

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.in: added GIMP_CHECK_VERSION macro and
	a features #define for 1.1.5

	* app/misc_cmds.c: added a gimp_version PDB function that
	returns the current version (new file)

	* app/internal_procs.c: register gimp_version PDB function

Mon Apr 12 21:54:48 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/boundary.c: code cleanup

	* app/levels.c: applied gimp-lecorfec-990314-0, added spin buttons
	to the levels dialog

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/font-map.scm: changes for updated
	gimp_text interface

Tue Apr 13 02:27:26 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/parasite.[ch]: Removed the parasite load/save functions.
	* app/paraslitelist.[ch]: Same as above, for the list load/save
	functions.

Mon Apr 12 23:44:14 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: The "From Selection" functionality is back and works 
	consistently with the "Current Layer only" option. Additionally
	I have used some code from the autocrop plug-in and you can now
	let The GIMP automatically select the crop-area for you. 
	Eventually this need some optimization. For sure the GUI needs to 
	be worked on a bit...

1999-04-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.c

	* app/rect_select.[ch]
	* app/text_tool.c
	* app/threshold.c
	* app/transform_tool.c

	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/toolsF.h: again: all tools :( 

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/tool_options.[ch]
	* app/selection_options.h
	* app/tool_options_ui.h: new files.

	Ok, this time it's general enough for future extensions:

	- The tool options structures are organized like the gtk object
	  system to allow derived tool options.
	- Renamed all create and reset functions to *_options_new() and
	  *_options_reset() to reflect this.
	- Changed tools_register() again. Now it takes just a pointer to a
	  ToolOptions structure.
	- Moved almost the entire tool options gui code to tool_options.c.
	- Visually separated the common selection options from the
	  tool-specific ones. I'd like to do the same with opacity/paint
	  mode in all paint tool options but I think this needs some more
	  discussion.

	* app/histogram_tool.c: changed packing boxes, label alignments.

	* app/paintbrush.c: some more sensitive settings. The gradient
	feature can now be toggled with a button. Hopefully didn't break
	anything.

Sun Apr 11 23:35:31 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/general.c: save string token length into "token_int".
	Fixed parsing of escape sequences, added '\0' and '"' sequences.

	* app/gimprc.c: implement new type "parasite".

	* app/gimpparasite.c: load and save parasiterc in "semi-ascii".

	* libgimp/parasite.[ch]: new function parasite_flags.

Sat Apr 10 23:33:26 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_picker.c: added a sample average feature (requested
	by Xach) that picks a color from the average of all the pixels
	from the source point within a given radius

1999-04-11  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/delete.xpm: I put the delete icon from gnome here,
	IMHO it looks nice.

Sat Apr 10 14:43:24 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool_cmds.c: doh, XLFD stuff is in decipoints

	* app/color_cmds.h: removed

	* app/color_cmds.c: pdbgened file now

	* app/lut_funcs.h: export ChannelLutType enum

	* app/internal_procs.c: register pdbgened color procs

	* app/menus.c: reverted keyboard underlines since they need more
	discussion

Sat Apr 10 15:48:46 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c: Velocity-sensitivity added to ink tool.

Fri Apr  9 21:45:10 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool_cmds.c: new file (from pdbgen)

	* app/Makefile.am: add new file, use AM_CPPFLAGS instead of CPPFLAGS

	* app/internal_procs.c: register pdbgened text_tool procs

	* app/text_tool.c: remove PDB stuff, export text_render and
	text_get_extents and SizeType and SUPERSAMPLE symbols

	* app/text_tool.c: remove PDB stuff

	* app/blend.[ch]
	* app/bucket_fill.[ch]
	* app/clone.[ch]
	* app/convolve.[ch]: export some enums

	* app/channel.h
	* app/paint_core.h: #define->enum

	* app/channel.c
	* app/gimpparasite.c
	* app/parasitelist.c
	* app/pixel_processor.c: warning cleanup

	* app/convert_cmds.c
	* app/paths_cmds.c: slight pdbgen changes

1999-04-09  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimphistogramF.h: new file containing typedef for
 	GimpHistogram.

	* app/gimphistogram.h: moved GimpHistogram typedef to
 	gimphistogramF.h

	* app/lut_funcs.h: include gimphistogramF.h again now that the
 	file actually exists.

Fri Apr  9 18:58:41 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/lut_funcs.h: changed the include to "gimphistogram.h" rather
	tha "gimphistogramF.h". I could have split the typedef struct
	_GimpHistogram GimpHistogram into a newly created gimphistogramF.h
	file as some modules seem to do, but chose this because it seemed
	like a less drastic fix.

1999-04-08  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/Makefile.am: build color_cmds, lut_funcs, and pixel_processor
	* app/app_procs.c: feedback in the splash screen when loading
 	parasites.
	* app/boundary.c: Optimized find_empty_segs.
	
	* app/brightness_contrast.[ch]
	* app/levels.[ch]
	* app/posterize.[ch]:
 	moved pdb and lut calculation code.  These files now contain only 
	GUI functions.

	* app/channel.c: Optimized channel_bounds (fewer compares, better
 	use of registers).  Use color_region instead of channel_*_segment
 	in channel_combine_rect.  Optimized channel_combine_ellipse by
 	skipping pixels inside of the ellipse.  Use
 	pixel_region_process_parallel in channel_combine_mask.  Use a
 	GimpLut in channel_invert, and channel_sharpen.

	* app/invert.c
	* app/equalize.c: moved the lut functions to lut_funcs.c
	
	* app/gimpdrawable.c, app/gimpdrawableP.h
	* app/gimpimage.c, app/gimpimageP.h: removed unused gimpmatrix 
	variables/includes.
	
	* app/gimplut.[ch]: added new function gimp_lut_process_inline
 	that operates on a single PixelRegion.

	* app/gimpparasite.[ch]: new functions to save/load parasiterc
	
	* app/parasitelist.[ch]: new functions to save/load ParasiteLists
 	in/from files.
	
	* libgimp/parasite.[ch]: new functions to load/save parasites.
	
	* app/internal_procs.c: get some procs from new location in 
	color_cmds.h.
	
	* app/pixel_region.[ch]: moved pixel_regions_process_parallel
 	related functions to a new file.

	* app/color_cmds.[ch]: new files for PDB
 	definitions/implementations of color correction functions.

	* app/lut_funcs.[ch]: new files to hold lut creation functions.

	* app/pixel_processor.[ch]: new files that contain the
 	pixel_regions_process_parallel routines.  Added some new
 	capabilities that are currently unused.
	
Fri Apr  9 01:52:23 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/autocrop/autocrop.c: Fixed a Bad Bug(TM).

1999-04-08  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.[ch]
	* app/curves.c
	* app/ellipse_select.c
	* app/eraser.c

	* app/posterize.c
	* app/rect_select.[ch]
	* app/text_tool.[ch]
	* app/threshold.c
	* app/transform_tool.c

	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/toolsF.h: in other words: all tools

	Implemented the "reset tool options" feature.
	- All tools register with a title string and a reset function now.
	- The tool options' variables have two related <var>_d (default)
	  and <var>_w (widget) variables to restore the default values.

	"Standardized" the tool options UI:
	- Put the stuff info a frame to give a hint that the dialog's
	  contents will change. 
	- table layout, sensitive setting, spacings, borders, ...
	
	As I had them all in my emacs simultaneously, I couldn't resist to
	standardize the tools' *.c files declaration parts ;) Ansi stuff.

Thu Apr  8 21:19:05 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/image_map.c
	
	Fixed boundary problem in new function image_map_get_color_at().

Thu Apr  8 07:12:10 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.[ch]: Ok, this is a little bit more than what we 
	discussed on the list: Basically, it allows to use the crop 
	tool as usual or as a resize-tool for layers and the image.
	
	The defaults are the new behaviour. Holding the <Alt>-Key
	when creating the selection toggles the "Allow-expand" mode,
	holding the <Shift>-key when cropping, gives you the opposite
	of your default setting for "Crop layers".

	The button for "Selection" is gone, but will reappear somewhere
	else soon. But first, I need some sleep...
	
Wed Apr  7 23:53:22 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/curves.c
	
	Just noticed a bug that has been around for ages. The preview
	update does not work in the curves dialog when free curve
	mode is selected. Fixed it. 

Wed Apr  7 22:44:02 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/curves.c
	* app/image_map.c
	* app/image_map.h

	Curves dialog now has "interactive feedback". Press and drag the 
	mouse button in the image window and a marker will appear in the
	curves dialog showing the channel value at that point.
	
Wed Apr  7 00:50:13 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.c: when using fixed_size selections create the
	selection into the direction the user moved the mouse

1999-04-06  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/rect_select.h: oops, didn't commit this one.

1999-04-06  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gimpunit.c
	* libgimp/gimpunit.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c
	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: enabled "percent" pseudo-unit.
	New function gimp_size_entry_set_size() to set the values which
	will be treated as 0% and 100%.

	* app/crop.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c: enable "percent".

	* app/rect_select.c fixed size selections can be made in units and
	percent now, table layout, label adjustment.

Mon Apr  5 23:24:30 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/bezier_select.c

	                          along the curve & the normal at the point).
	  gimp_path_get_tattoo 
	  gimp_get_path_by_tattoo


       	Paths now have tattoos (similar to the layer and image tattoos).

	* app/move.c 
	* app/scroll.c 

	Try to fix the problem where mouse events from the rulers get
	mixed up with those from the canvas causing guides & image dragging
	to "jump" around when the mouse enters the ruler areas.

Mon Apr  5 23:59:37 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/color_balance.c: Color-balance didn't work when used
	from a script because the LUTs weren't set. This is fixed now 
	and SOTA-Chrome works again.

Mon Apr  5 22:28:01 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am

	* app/gimpunit.c: had the wrong copyright header.

	* app/info_dialog.c: correctly set the spinbuttons' digits.

	removed some unused variables.

	* app/crop.c

Sat Apr  3 20:42:48 1999  ape@spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/paintbrush.c:  Skip //  comments.
	* app/paint_core.c : Use /* */ intead of //.  IRIX ver. fails

1999-04-03  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/shear_tool.c: forgot this file. Should compile again now,
	sorry :(

1999-04-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gimage_mask.[ch]: made function headers ansi compliant.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: minor GUI and signal handling
	changes. Added a WM hint pixmap to the prefs dialog but commented
	it out because it looked ugly. If someone has a nice pixmap,
	please try it and tell me ;)

	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/perspective_tool.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/info_dialog.[ch]: the info_dialog allows scales, spinbuttons

	gimp_size_entry_add_field() which allows a more flexible GUI
	layout. More intelligent signal handling.

Tue Mar 30 22:17:43 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: Thumbnails save with checkerboard-alpha.
	Saved thumbnail comments include the file size.

Tue Mar 30 20:50:21 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c:
	3.00.01 - Round image timing to nearest 10ms instead of
	truncating.  Insert a mandatory 10ms minimum delay
	for the frames of looping animated GIFs, to avoid
	generating an evil CPU-sucking animation that 'other'
	GIF-animators sometimes like to save.

Mon Mar 29 19:05:03 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.4 release

Mon Mar 29 23:39:49 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: Squeezed out a little more fun.

	* plug-ins/gap/README: doh, forgot to commit that one yesterday

1999-03-29  Pavel Machek  <pavel@artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* app/menus.c (toolbox_entries): underline letters so keyboard is
	bit more usable

Sun Mar 28 14:03:59 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sharpen/sharpen.c (rgba_filter, gray_filter,
	graya_filter): fixed a stupid bug causing sharpen to fail in the
	cases other than plain rgb.

Sun Mar 28 23:56:46 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap/README: reflect the fact that GAP is now part of
	the distribution
	* plug-ins/gap/gimp_1.0.2: removed since the files were duplicates
	* plug-ins/gap/*.c: use g_getenv, g_malloc, g_new and g_free 

Sat Mar 27 22:37:35 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/procedural_db.h: #include <glib.h>

	* app/paintbrush.[ch]: added the ability to select the 
	gradient repeat mode from the gui. Made the gradient
	length slider hopefully a bit more useful (ie, a
	more useful range)


1999-03-27  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/color_select.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/palette_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c: applied a patch from Marco Lamberto
	<lm@geocities.com> which unifies actionareas ("Cancel" rightmost
	and default). Did the same in some more dialogs.

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c
	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.[ch]: completely reworked the preferences
	dialog:

	- select the notebook's pages with a tree.
	- reordered the categories. Please give me feedback, this really
	  needs to be intuitive.
	- removed lots of unused #include's.
	- turned the prefs. dialog into a test site for new convenience
	  constructors. These changes are however not visible. Flame me
	  until they're perfect ;) When finished, this stuff can save
	  *many* lines of gtk+ code.

	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c: made it circular.

1999-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: gimp_image_get_unit() doesn't need a
	g_return_if_fail()

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: memory leak & compiler warning

	* configure.in
	* gimprc.in
	* user_install
	* user_install.bat
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/*: added the FractalExplorer plugin.

	* app/install.c: ditto and made the install help text more
	editable by moving it to an array.

Thu Mar 25 22:44:36 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Ok. I'll add the file this time..

Thu Mar 25 22:40:36 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	The paths .pdb stub for Yosh to look at.

1999-03-25  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_funcs.[ch]: Added an edge_lock parameter to
 	thin_region.  Split the radius parameter into xradius and yradius
 	in thin_region and fatten_region.

	* app/channel.c: fixed a bug in channel_bounds that I introduced
 	last time I tried to fix a bug in channel_bounds.  Minor
 	modifications to work with the improved thin/fatten region
 	functions.

Wed Mar 24 11:05:38 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: use AC_PATH_PROGS to find perl.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/gap/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/gap/.../Makefile.am (all subdirs)
	Cleaned up the mess I left when adding the gap plug-in. Sorry!

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_filter_foreach.c: Use g_getenv, g_malloc 
	and g_free.

Sun Mar 21 23:11:31 EST 1999  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/paintbrush.c: oops, forgot to make fade work
	again after the gradient stuff. Fixed.

Mon Mar 22 00:38:20 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-
	* Makefile.am
	* internal_procs.c

	* paths_dialog.c
	* paths_dialog.h
	* xcf.c

	New:-
	* paths_cmds.c
	* paths_cmds.h

	PDB functions for paths. (More to follow).
	Functions are:-
		gimp_path_list
		gimp_path_get_points
		gimp_path_get_current
		gimp_path_set_current
		gimp_path_set_points
		gimp_path_stroke_current	
	
Sun Mar 21 15:29:38 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c app/edit_selection.c app/move.c:
	Happy-fun opaque layer moves.

	* app/edit_selection.c: I doubt that using button3 to abort
	a layer move has worked for a long time.  I rewrote some
	stuff and moved the 'abort' button to button2.  Hold it down
	when you release button1, to abort the current move.  It
	doesn't actually abort, it just automatically does an undo.

Sat Mar 20 22:51:51 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* fileops.c: The file revert operation clears the undo stack
	upon a revert to get rid of the actions caused by the open
	operation.

Sat Mar 20 21:55:53 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* disp_callbacks.c: Reduce some possibly-redundant re-renders
	on expose.

	* acinclude.m4
	* config.guess
	* config.sub
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: upgrade to libtool 1.2f

	* autogen.sh: libtool is not required to autogen gimp

	* Makefile.am: add README.perl to EXTRA_DIST

Fri Mar 19 04:01:04 EST 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>
	
	* plug-ins/mail/mail.c: added a from: field, made
	it check gimprc for a gump-from field (per request
	by tigert). fixed it so it would actually use
	the last vals properly.

	* plug-ins/gap/Makefile.am: removed the SUBDIRS line
	so it at least builds. Probabaly not the right fix,
	but while I'm committing...

1999-03-18  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/ops_buttons.h: removed a c++ style comment

	* app/paint_funcs.c: applied Craig Wiegert's patch to fix
 	the rounding errors in the scaling code.
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: Use a mutex lock in disolve pixels instead of
 	rand_r on linux systems since linux's rand_r appears to be broken.

	* app/bezier_select.c: applied Shuji Narazaki's patch that corrects
 	for layer offsets in bezier_stroke.

Thu Mar 18 19:35:48 EST 1999  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/paint_core.c
	* app/paint_core.h: moved all the code for figuring out the
	paint_core->distance to color stuff to paint_core.[ch]. Updated
	paintbrush.c to use the new function. Also now can either loop
	thorugh the gradient (sawtooth, start->end, start->end or 
	triangle start->end,end->start). Also mode for going
	thought the gradient once, forwards or backwards. None of these
	options are available from the gui or the PDB yet though.

Thu Mar 18 02:12:26 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/gap/* (new files)
	Added the GAP (GIMP Animation Plugin) created by Wolfgang
	Hofer. Eventually we'll think about making this a 
	seperate package, but now it's here for testing and your
	pleasure.

1999-03-18  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* configure.in plug-ins/Makefile.am: Add wmf plug-in.

	* plug-ins/wmf: New subdirectory. Wmf plug-in finally works OK
	on X11 now, with a workaround for a GDK bug.

Wed Mar 17 21:46:08 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-ins/exchange/exchange.c: fixed NON_INTERACTIVE
	and RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS modes

Tue Mar 16 23:39:26 EST 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/paintbrush.c: paintbrush_motion, added the ability
	to paint with the colors from a gradient. In 
	create_paint_options, added a scale for the length
	of the gradient to paint. Also added a PDB call.

	*  app/paintbrush.h, internal_procs.c: exported
	 gimp_paintbrush_extended_gradient to the PDB

Tue Mar 16 19:12:08 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/batch.c: make the perl-server independent of script-fu. This
	also speeds up starup considerably.

1999-03-16  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gdisplay.h: double the length of the cursor_format_str as
	users may define strange units now

	* app/xcf.c: forgot a sanity check when loading/saving the user
	unit property

1999-03-16  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	This implements the rest of the unit system (unitrc loading and
	saving and full PDB interface)

	* Makefile.am
	* gimp.1
	* user_install
	* user_install.bat
	* unitrc: new file (default unit database) and some documentation

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpunit.c
	* app/gimpunit_cmds.h
	* app/unitrc.h: new files enabling the unit database and PDB
	access to the unit system

	* app/app_procs.c: parse and save unitrc
	* app/gimprc.[ch]: enable unit parsing. New function
	init_parse_buffers() to enable unitrc to be loaded before gimprc

	* app/gimage_cmds.[ch]: new PDB procedures which set/return an
	image's unit 

	* app/install.c: mention unitrc installation

	* app/internal_procs.c: install unit procedures

	* app/xcf.c: new xcf property for user defined units. An image's
	unit is saved as either an integer ID (built in units) or as
	a full unit definition without any ID

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: moved gimpunit.o from libgimpi.a to
	libgimp.a

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: get/set an image's unit with PDB calls

	* libgimp/gimpunit.h: this file is now the header for both
	app/gimpunit.c and libgimp/gimpunit.c

	* libgimp/gimpunit.c: does the unit calls as PDB calls now

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]: enable user unit functionality and a
	unit selection dialog

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: disble hilighting on focus_in_event and
	minor bugfixes

	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c: set image unit to "mm" if tiff unit is
	"cm", save "cm" if image unit is metric

Mon Mar 15 14:40:29 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sharpen/sharpen.c: Fixed the algorithm so that it
	doesn't make the image lighter for high sharpness values. Also,
	increased the accuracy of the algorithm so that it won't degrade
	the bit depth.

Mon Mar 15 01:34:08 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/ops_buttons.[c|h]: implemented a way to catch the 
	modifier key that was pressed when the button was clicked

	* app/[layers|channels|paths]_dialog.c: changed the ops_button
	arrays to reflect the changes described above and implemented
	a few power-user features in the dialogs:
	( Shift->Layer Up / Layer Down  moves to top/bottom
	  Shift->Channel To Selection   adds the channel to the sel
	  Ctrl->Channel To Selectio     subtracts from the selection ) 

1999-03-14  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* gimprc.in: removed two unused directories from plug-in-path.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c: make the first spinbutton grab the focus
	and one more unit initialisation bugfix

	* app/interface.c: grab focus in query_[string|int|..]_box()
	This still needs to be done in many dialogs to be consistent.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: made the module-path configurable

	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.[ch]: change the order of the buttons to
	match the order in the L&C dialog

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: enabled highlighting of the
	spinbuttons' contents on focus_in_event.
	Ugly new function gimp_size_entry_grab_focus() because it seems
	impossible to implement gtk_widget_grab_focus(sizeentry). 

Sun Mar 14 17:56:14 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: correctly set the status of the
	chain_button in the monitors section when creating the dialog

Sun Mar 14 13:26:11 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: reverted Michaels change as it is defintely
	wrong. The current behaviour is probably not perfect and I'll try
	to fix that.

1999-03-14  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/xcf.c:

	Improved the rle compression routine.  It compresses
 	photographic images ~8% better and is fully backwards compatible.
	
  	Modified the tile load/save routines to buffer their data and
 	only make one read/write call per tile.  This results in a 3-4X
 	improvement in load and save times.

	Modified the path load/save routines to work properly when gint is
 	not a 32 bit type.

	* app/pathsP.h: Changed the types of some struct data members
	to be consistant with what is saved in the xcf files.

1999-03-14  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.c: checked in a buggy version before ;)

1999-03-14  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/app_procs.c: only save sessionrc if the corresponding
	preferences option is enabled

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: preferences renovation part I: the
	directories page uses the new widgets from libgimp

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* ligbimp/gimpi.def
	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.[ch]: new widgets which enable a more
	comfortable file and searchpath selection

	* Makefile.am
	* pixmaps/no.xpm
	* pixmaps/yes.xpm: pixmaps used by the new widgets

Sat Mar 13 19:46:54 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* pixmaps/ptoselection.xpm -> pixmaps/toselection.xpm
	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c: Provide a button to convert a channel
	into a selection. Share the xpm with the paths-dialog. Add two new
	menu entries that allow to add or subtract the channel to/from the 
	current selection (as suggested by Wolfgang Hofer). 

1999-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	Moved all pixmaps and bitmaps from app/ and libgimp/ to pixmaps/

	* app/tools/*
	* libgimp/chain.xpm: removed these files

	* pixmaps/*.[xpm|xbm]: new directory containing all pixmaps

	* app/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* Makefile.am: changed list of EXTRA_DIST files accordingly

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/palette.c
	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.c: adjusted some #include's

Fri Mar 12 21:30:57 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c

	Some code cleanups and bug fixes. Fixed problem with "copy" path
	producing very long names. 

	Added functionality to import/export paths to files. (It was 
	there before!)

	Also added some new bezier_stroke code that Shuji Narazaki posted
	to the gimp-devel list.

	* plug-ins/plugindetails/plugindetails.c

	Removed unwanted <regex.h>. 
	Thanks to Tan Koan-Sin <freedom@csie.nctu.edu.tw> for pointing 
	this out.

Fri Mar 12 22:15:49 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimp.c: split gimp_quit into two functions, gimp_quit
	and gimp_close. Let gimp_main return to the calling function in
	the common cases (i.e. not in the error case).

1999-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: correct resolution size_entry
	initialisation.

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: fixed the update bug reported by Marc.
	Works now but still needs discussion...

1999-03-11  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: made the INT_MULT3 macro be more accurate.

1999-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	This is mostly unit stuff and code cleanup
	
	* libgimp/gimpi.def: add some functions

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: new function
	gimp_size_entry_set_refval_digits() which allows for float pixel
	input. SIGFPE bugfix from Yasuhiro Shirasaki
	<yasuhiro@awa.tohoku.ac.jp>, minor bugfixes.

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]: add a separator after "pixels",
	bugfixes.

	* app/interface.[ch]: split up the old query_string_box() into
	query_[string|int|float|size]_box(). All functions take an
	optional GtkObject* parameter and connect to that object's
	"destroy" signal, this fixes some segfaults. And a global
	s/container_border_width/container_set_border_width/

	* app/commands.s: grow, shrink, border, feather now use the
	query_size_box. Used MIN(xres,yres) for now for the pixel<->unit
	calculations. Fixed some memory leaks.

	* app/global_edit.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c: changed the query_string_box() calls

Thu Mar 11 19:42:12 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in, config.h.in: added test for _exit (mirrors the
	change in plug-ins/perl/etc/configure.frag)

1999-03-10  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* plug-ins/wind/wind.c, plug-ins/bumpmap/bumpmap.c: Set
 	appropriate values for the tile cache.  This makes a large speed
 	difference.

1999-03-10  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/devices.c: don't let session management set the size of the
	"Device Status" dialog, as the number of devices may change
	between sessions

Mon Mar  8 16:45:06 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.3 release

	* gimprc.5.in: use @GIMP_VERSION@

Mon Mar  8 16:27:25 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/hue_saturation.c: comment out Raph's saturation changes,
	didn't work in all cases

1999-03-08  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/devices.c (devices_write_rc): A line had been deleted by
 	mistake.

	* app/frac.c: Removed some CRs.

	* app/install.c (install_run): Typo.

	* modules/module.def: New file.

	* Makefile.am app/Makefile.am libgimp/Makefile.am
 	modules/Makefile.am: Added Win32 implementation files to
 	distributed file set.

Mon Mar  8 21:23:10 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/layer_cmds.c: updated gimp_layer_new and gimp_layer_set_mode to
	accept a DIVIDE_MODE argument.

1999-03-08  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/plug_in.c: use g_io_channel_close/unref pairs instead of close
	in plug_in_open().

1999-03-07  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	Second batch of Win32 merging. This time also some Unix code is
	affected, but the semantics should stay the same. Plug-in
	communication now uses GIOChannels, not plain file descriptors
	(this change only affects a few files).
	
	* README.win32,config.h.win32,gimprc.win32,user_install.bat: New files.
	
	* libgimp/gimpenv.[ch]: New files. gimpenv contains functions that
	handle directory and file names specific to the GIMP installation
	and runtime environment.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: Include gimpenv.h. Declare variables with
	__declspec on Win32. MAIN() defines also WinMain() on Win32.
	gimp_gtkrc() declaration moved to gimpenv.h.
	
	* libgimp/{gimp.c,gimpmenu.c,gimpprotocol.[ch],
	gimptile.c,gimpwire.[ch]}: Use GIOChannels instead of file
	descriptors.

	* libgimp/gimp.c: (gimp_extension_process): Calculate microsecond
	value in timeval correctly from millisecond parameter.
	
	* libgimp/{gimpmatrix.c,gserialize.c}: Include <string.h>.

	* libgimp/gimpmenu.c: (gimp_setup_callbacks): Call
	gimp_request_wakeups().

	* libgimp/gimpmodule.h: Don't declare module_init and
	module_unload when compiling the module itself, because of clashes
	with the G_MODULE_EXPORT.

	* libgimp/gimpwire.c: Use g_warning instead of g_print. No
	terminating newlines necessary in g_error calls.
	
	* libgimp/Makefile.am: Add gimpenv.[ch].
	(CPPFLAGS): Define DATADIR.

	* libgimp/{makefile.msc,gimpfeatures.h.win32,gimp.def,
	gimpi.def,gimpui.def}: New files.
	
	* modules/Makefile.am (CPPFLAGS): Define MODULE_COMPILATION.

	* modules/makefile.msc: New file.

	* app/{about_dialog.c,app_procs.c,gimprc.c,install.c,
	tips_dialog.c}: Use gimp_data_directory() instead of DATADIR.

	* app/app_procs.c (app_init): Use gimp_gtkrc() and g_get_tmp_dir().

	* app/batch.c: Need <io.h> with MSC. (batch_init): Fix brace bug.

	* app/{color_notebook.c,docindexif.c,ink.c}: Include <string.h>.

	* app/{devices.c,docindex.c,gimprc.c,menus.c,plug_in.c,session.c}:
	Use gimp_personal_rc_file().

	* app/docindexif.h: IDEAPATH unneeded.

	* app/errors.c: Use g_error() on Win32, at least. Don't use
	g_on_error_query() on Win32.

	* app/general.c (get_token): Handle \r, \n and \z (control-Z).

	* app/gimprc.c (open_backup_file): Redone. Now you can pass in the
	name of a secondary file to use if the primary one doesn't exist.

	* app/gimprc.[ch]: gimp_directory() removed, is now in
	libgimp/gimpenv.[ch].

	* app/install.c (install_run): Add Win32 code. We cannot use popen
	as in Unix, because the Microsoft runtime library's _popen doesn't
	work in GUI applications. So just run the bat file in a console
	window and let the user spot any errors...

	* app/interface.c: Include dialog_handler.h.

	* app/layer.c: Include libgimp/parasite.h.

	* app/plug_in.c: No terminating newline necessary in g_message()
	calls.

	* app/{plug_in.c,session.c}: Open settings files that *are* text
	in text mode, not binary.
	
	* app/plug_in.c: Add Win32 code. (plug_in_write_rc_string): Escape
	problematic characters (\r, \n and control-Z). Use
	plug_in_write_rc_string() to write program name, too (contains
	backslashes on Win32...). Use GIOChannels.

	* app/text_tool.c: Shouldn't use gdk_colormap_alloc_color() to
	allocate black and white on Win32 after all.

	* app/tile_swap.c: Include <stdio.h>

	* app/{gimp.def,gimp.rc,makefile.msc,wilber.ico}: New
	files. Thanks to Paolo Bonzini for the Wilber icon.

	* app/Makefile.am (CPPFLAGS): GIMPDIR or DATADIR not needed,
	handled by libgimp/gimpenv.c functions.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/{alien-glow-button,beveled-button,
	beveled-pattern-button,beveled-pattern-heading,gimp-headers,
	gimp-labels,hsv-graph,i26-gunya2,image-structure,pupi-button,
	,title-header}.scm: Use the gimp-text*-fontname forms
	calls. Register having corresponding SF-FONT parameters. Thanks to
	Piet van Oostrum for this.

1999-03-07  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/brush_select.c: pop up the brush-edit dialog whenever the
 	user creates a new brush.

Sat Mar  6 03:04:31 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: correctly initialize the zoom indicator
	in the title and the statusbar

Fri Mar  5 21:45:39 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	This is a bit of a biggy. Added paths to layers & channels 
	dialog. This is not complete yet (it still has some rough edges ;-)

	New:-

	* paths_dialog.c
	* paths_dialog.h
	* pathsP.h

	These are the core parts of the paths dialog & interaction.

	* tools/penadd.xpm 
	* tools/pendel.xpm 
	* tools/pennorm.xpm
	* tools/penedit.xpm
	* tools/penstroke.xpm

	New images found in the dialog. Maybe someone with a better
	artistic flair could replace these?

	Changed:-

	* Makefile.am

	Added new files for build

	* layers_dialog.c
	
	Added new tab for paths.

	* bezier_select.h
	* bezier_selectP.h
	* bezier_select.c

	Rearrangement & fixes. Not finished yet.

	* iscissors.c

	Header file changes. (Need to include more headers).

	* gdisplay.c
	* gdisplay.h

	Hmmm... Added a function that did a mapping from gimage to gdisp.
	This is a little bit of a "hack", but it was needed.. really.

	* ops_buttons.h
	* ops_buttons.c

	Enhanced to create more types of button ops. Used in the paths dialog.

	* channels_dialog.c

	Header file changes?

	* xcf.c

	Paths stored in new PROP. Yosh.. I did as you and Adam suggested. 

	* gimpimage.c
	* gimpimage.h
	* gimpimageP.h

	Added paths items to the image structures.


1999-03-04  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/gimprc.c: Added a g_strdup() on DEFAULT_IMAGE_TITLE_FORMAT,
	otherwise it would try to free a constant string when cancling out of
	prefs or changing the title-style.

Wed Mar  3 18:38:31 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	More unit/resolution stuff (most of it from Michael).
	
	* app/gimpimage.c: use defaults from gimprc

	* app/gdisplay.c: a new format_string for coordinates

	* blend.c
	* crop.c
	* edit_selection.c
	* rect_select.c: use the new format when displaying sizes
	in the statusbar

	* file_new_dialog.c: cleaned up the advanced/simple cases

Wed Mar  3 17:59:09 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.5.in
	* gimprc.in
	* libgimp/gimpunit.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c : Seems that Michael had created some
	more patches I didn't knew of.
	This commit now should bring it all uptodate. 

Wed Mar  3 15:39:01 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.[ch]: that looks much better now

Wed Mar  3 13:24:00 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.5.in
	* gimprc.in
	* libgimp/gimpunit.c
	* libgimp/gimpunit.h
	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Hopefully synced the work on 
	real-world-units by applying (most of) the patches Michael
	Natterer has provided. Fixed a few minor and cosmetic bugs 
	in those patches.

Tue Mar  2 01:24:41 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/chain.xpm
	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.c
	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.h: a mockup for a new widget that 
	indicates that two entries are connected. Please feel free to
	hack this as I'm afraid I won't find the time to finish this.

	* app/file_new_dialogs: a first attempt to make the dialog 
	easier to use w/o loosing the flexibility it provided.

1999-02-28  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/Makefile.am: added gimphistogram*, histogramwidget*, 
	removed histogram.[ch]

	* app/histogram.[ch]: removed.  replaced with histogramwidget.[ch].

	* app/{gimphistogramP.h, gimphistogram.h, gimphistogram.c}: new
 	functions that calculate histograms in parallel and perform
 	calculations on them.
	
	* app/histogramwidget.[ch]: Same as old histogram.[ch], only it is
 	now a real widget, and it uses GimpHistograms instead of arrays of
 	values.

	* app/curves.c: #include gimphistogram.h instead of histogram.h.
	
	* app/equalize.c: use GimpHistogram and GimpLut.
	
	* app/gimpbrush.c, app/gimpimage.c, app/gimpset.c: use 
	GTK_RUN_FIRST in calls to gimp_signal_new.

	* app/histogram_tool.c, app/levels.c, app/threshold.c: modified to
 	use the new HistogramWidget.

	* app/paint_funcs.c: removed some unused variables.
	
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: only display the num-processor field
 	if we are configured --with-mp
	
	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: removed a couple of c++ style comments.
	
Sun Feb 28 23:48:17 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: loosened check for perl version, perl5.004 is now
 	supposed to work with gimp-perl.

Sat Feb 27 23:25:55 EST 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/xach-effect.scm: removed
	some old dead code that was keeping it from working. 
	Now xach's name is untarnished again.

Sat Feb 27 18:07:53 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/scale.c: use image's units, not the ruler units, when
	    dimentioning the rulers.  Gimprc ruler-units syntax has no
	    use anymore.

	* app/gdisplay.[ch]: applied statusbar unit display patch from
 	    Michael Natterer.

Sat Feb 27 16:54:51 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: When a gimage's colourmap is changed,
	implicitly queue an update of the whole gimage.

	* plug-ins/vinvert/vinvert.c: Speed up - iterate over
	regions, not rows.

	* plug-ins/autostretch_hsv/autostretch_hsv.
	* plug-ins/c_astretch/c_astretch.c
	* plug-ins/normalize/normalize.c
	* plug-ins/vinvert/vinvert.c:
	Remove the explicit (and actually incorrect) update when
	changing a gimage's colourmap.

Fri Feb 26 21:19:10 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: 
	Many revisions to the box-cut quantizer used in RGB->INDEXED
	conversion.  Box to be cut is chosen on the basis of posessing an
	axis with the largest sum of weighted perceptible error, rather
	than based on volume or population.  The box is split along this
	axis rather than its longest axis, at the point of error mean
	rather than simply at its centre.  Error-limiting in the F-S
	dither has been disabled - it may become optional again later.  If
	you're convinced that you have an image where the old dither looks
	better, let me know.

Thu Feb 25 11:40:36 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/hue_saturation.c (hue_saturation_calculate_transfers):
	Made increasing the saturation more subtle - which is what
	you want for enhancing the color in photos.

Thu Feb 25 12:19:50 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: make use of the new GimpSizeEntry
	widget (patch provided by Michael Natterer). 
	I'm not yet content with the way two entries are glued together
	by "Force equal ...", but I'm working on it.

Thu Feb 25 02:21:52 CST 1999 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: special case Close/Quit in <Image>/File
	  to always be at the bottom of the menu.

Wed Feb 24 19:19:07 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: applied the patch Michael Natterer
	sent me. This makes the gimpsizeentry much more flexible.

Tue Feb 23 02:57:16 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/drawable_cmds.c: fix documentation for
	drawable_type_with_alpha.

Tue Feb 23 00:05:39 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in.c
	app/plug_in.h: Moved the RunModeType enum
	into the header so we can use it elsewhere (e.g. fileops)

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c
	plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: Don't show progress-bars if we're
	running noninteractively.  This makes thumbnail updating
	look more pleasant.  Try to do the same for all file plugins
	(and others)!

	* app/fileops.c: Reworked the thumbnail display again, fixed
	some buglets, file_open_image() is RunMode aware, added some
	tweaks, rhubarb rhubarb, merged in some 'cosmetic' tweaks
	from Marco.

Mon Feb 22 14:08:59 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/procedural_db.h, app/internal_procs.c, app/procedural_db.c
	libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.in: "gimp_procedural_db_get_data_size"
	exists, but has never been registered (of course it was buggy as
	well). This is especially funny since the function in _gimp-perl_
	that should be using it since half a year tested the wrong symbol
	for its presence, so this went undetected. One could argue that
	this is the least used gimp function ever ;->

1999-02-22 adam, blah blah

	* app/appenv.h: fixed a macro bug waiting to happen

	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: some crappy tweaks

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: debugging turned off

1999-02-22  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/channel.c: fixed bug in channel_bounds

Sun Feb 21 22:37:56 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpentry.[ch]: removed
	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: new files
	Moved the gimpentry stuff to gimpsizeentry and changed it to use
	the new gimpunit functionality.

Sun Feb 21 20:43:00 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]: new files
	Added the gimpunitmenu-widget Michael Natterer contributed.
	Now lets see how this integrates with the gimpentry-widget...

Sat Feb 20 16:12:33 CST 1999 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/tips_dialog.c: Add default to Cancel button, remove
	  unset GTK_RECEIVES_DEFAULT from prev/next buttons (they
	  are like toolbar buttons), changed abreviated prev to
	  previous, prev/next button are now same size, cancel button
	  is in a button box.  Added vboxes where necessary to prevent
	  prev/next and check button from filling vertically.

	* app/app_procs.c: when splashscreen dialog is larger than the 
	  logo, (due to huge font), center logo.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c: patch from Marco Lamb <lm@geocities.com>
	  disallows resizing, changes vertical expanding of widgets to 
	  not occur

	* app/palette.c: patch from Marco Lamb <lm@geocities.com>.  Makes
	  +/- buttons for zoom pixmaps (eventually, these can be replaced
	  with a magnifying glass with a little +/- I think), so that they
	  no longer expand as they did before.  I modified his patch so it
	  did not create a misused toolbar.  I did some other stuff here too,
	  moved Close button to the left, made it the window's default,
	  and unset GTK_RECEIVES_DEFAULT off of the non-bottom buttons.

	* app/actionarea.c: another patch from Marco Lamb <lm@geocities.com>.
	  This one changes buttons to be put in a button box which is right
	  justified.  If we decide later that spread is better, we can 
	  change this easy enough.

	* app/tools/zoom_in.xpm, app/tools/zoom_out.xpm: + and - graphics.

	* libgimp/gimpunit.h
	  libgimp/gimpunit.c: New files from Michael Natterer 
	  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>, gimp_unit_* routines.

	* app/gimage.h
	  app/gimpimage.h
	  app/gimpimage.c
	  app/gimpimageP.h
	  app/xcf.c: Patches from Michael Natterer <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>,
	  which keep a unit assocated with an image. 

1999-02-21  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	First batch of changes to merge the Win32 version. This will be
	done in pieces, don't expect to be able to compile on Win32 from
	these sources yet.  And of course, the official version of GTk+
	doesn't include the Win32 stuff yet.
 	
	* configure.in acconfig.h: Check for <sys/param.h> and
	<sys/times.h>. Check for rint().

	* app/appenv.h: There shouldn't be any need to include
	<gdk/gdkx.h>. GDK hides the windowing system. Thus we cannot use
	GDK_DISPLAY either, and the DISPLAY macro must go.
	
	* app/*.c: Guard inclusion of Unix-only headers. Include config.h
	(as first header) where needed. Use G_DIR_SEPARATOR(_S) and
	G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR(_S) where appropriate.

	* app/app_procs.c: Unreference fonts after use.

	* app/asupsample.c: Include <stdlib.h> for size_t.

	* app/batch.c (batch_init): No batch mode from stdin on Win32.

	* app/blob.c app/gimpbrushgenerated.c: Define M_PI if needed.

	* app/clone.c app/disp_callbacks.c app/rotate_tool.c
	app/scale_tool.c: Use GDK constants instead of Xlib ones (with
	identical value).

	* app/color_area.c app/color_select.c app/gdisplay.c
	app/parasitelist.c app/preferences_dialog.c app/tile_manager.c:
	Include <string.h> as we use functions from there.

	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c (ipal_draw_cell): Watch out for
	allocation width and height calues that are in fact
	negative. (This can happen at least on Win32 for some reason.)

	* app/datafiles.c: Define S_IS* macros for MSC.

	* app/docindex.c: Reorder header files. Otherwise guint32
	isn't available for gimpimageF.h, for instance.

	* app/docindexif.h: No need to incude <gdk/gdkprivate.h>.

	* app/errorconsole.c: Define S_I[RW]USR for MSC.

	* app/general.c: Define S_ISREG for MSC.

	* app/fileops.c: Include <process.h> and <direct.h> for MSC.

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c app/paint_funcs.c app/posterize.c:
	Define rint() using floor if necessary.

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c: Use unsigned char for lookup table.

	* app/gimpdrawable.c: Use <string.h>, not <strings.h>.

	* app/main.c: Conditionalize on signal names.

	* app/module_db.c: Include <time.h> for time_t. Handle Win32 DLL
	names.

	* app/palette.c (palette_create_entries): If no HOME, ignore ~.

	* app/procedural_db.c app/tips_dialog.c: No need to open text
	files in binary mode.

	* app/temp_buf.c: Include <process.h> for MSC.

	* app/text_tool.c: Use GDK to get black and white pixel values. 

1999-02-19  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c (save_dialog): Changed the plugin dialog 
	labels to remind the most common cases: PC vs Mac byte order.
	This is more useful information to an artist :)

Wed Feb 17 23:36:45 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/color_balance.c (struct _ColorBalanceDialog): lookup tables
 	should be size 256, not 255.

1999-02-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimplutP.h: fixed error in struct declaration
	
1999-02-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimplut[FP].h: oops, these should have been added with the
 	last commit.

1999-02-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimplut.[ch]: new source files that implement pixel Look Up
 	Table functions.
	
	* app/Makefile.am: build gimplut.[ch]

	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/curves.c
	* app/invert.c
	* app/levels.c
	* app/posterize.c: Use the new lut functions.  Use
 	pixel_region_process_parallel in the PDB versions of these routines.

	* libgimp/parasite.h
	* libgimp/parasite.c: new functions parasite_name and
 	parasite_compare.
	
	* app/gimpdrawable.c:
	* app/gimpdrawable.h: new function
 	gimp_drawable_get_color_at(...) returns the RGBA[color index]
 	value at a specified position in the drawable.  Don't set the dirty
 	bit on the image if a new parasite is the same as the old.
	
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.h new function
 	gimp_image_get_color_at(...) returns the RGBA[color index]
 	value at a specified position in the drawable.  Don't set the dirty
 	bit on the image if a new parasite is the same as the old.
	
	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/color_picker.c: use the new gimp_*_get_color_at
 	functions instead of messing with the tiles.
	
	* app/layer.c: fixed a minor warning.

	* app/commands.c: 
	don't scale the image if the new size == the old size
	
	* app/channel.c: optimized channel_bounds by only checking the
 	pixels in a tile if it is not already entirely within the
 	currently computed bounds.
	
Mon Feb 15  21:14:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/prep4gif.pl
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/alpha2color.pl
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/windy.pl
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/feedback.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachlego.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachshadow.pl: added email addresses and 
       put things in a more sane spot in the menus

Mon Feb 15 05:23:18 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/color_balance.c (color_balance): Use the rgb_to_l function.

Sun Feb 14 22:16:16 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/paint_funcs.c app/paint_funcs.h : New function rgb_to_l for
 	when we only want the luminosity.  (rgb_to_hls): Use "else if" for
 	case which can't be true if previous test succeeded.

	* app/color_balance.c (struct _ColorBalanceDialog): use
	lookup tables with unsigned values for the RGB components.

Sun Feb 14 23:27:57 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* docs/parasites.txt: Added some suggestions from Jay Cox.

Sun Feb 14 4:28:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* plug-ins/sinus/sinus.c: changed macro definition supplied by
	Thomas to allow tilable sinus again.

Sun Feb 14 23:11:30 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimptile.c (gimp_tile_cache_ntiles): Round up, not down,
	when setting the tilecachesize, in case we ever do 63x63 tiles ;)

Sun Feb 14 20:43:55 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/channels_dialog.c: don't #include resize.h - it's not needed
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: ditto.

	* app/resize.c: do all dialog creation here to factor out lots of
	     common code in commands.c and layers_dialog.c.  Also cancel
	     resize/scale dialog on destruction/removal of images/layers -
	     proper fix for Peter Teichman's bug.
	* app/resize.h: new prototype for resize_widget_new() - beginnings
	     of resolution-aware scaling.
	* app/commands.c: pull all the resize/scale dialog creation stuff
	     out to resize.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: same again.

	* app/layer.c: add REMOVED signal, sent when a layer is removed
	     from an image.  Layers typically aren't destroyed until their
	     undo info expires.
	* app/layer.h: prototype for layer_removed() call.
	* app/gimpimage.c: send out removed signal.

Sun Feb 14 02:33:42 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: Corrected argument name.
	* docs/parasites.txt: Add some thoughts about parasite
	data formats.

1999-02-14  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: applied Michael Natterer's fix for the
 	layer movement bug.

Sun Feb 14 01:27:29 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	New manpage plus bumper fun pack of bugfixes.

	* gimprc.5.in: NEW FILE: beginnings of some docs on gimprc file
	     format.
	* configure.in: generate gimprc.5 from gimprc.5.in
	* Makefile.am: install gimprc.5
	* .cvsignore: ignore gimprc.5, it's auto generated.

	* gimp.1: fix a few paths and URLs.  Mention the modules/
	     directory in user's gimpdir.

	* app/commands.c: cancel resize or scale dialogs when image
 	     they're for is destroyed, rather than segfaulting when Ok is
 	     clicked.  Thanks to Peter Teichman <peter@zeno.dorm.duke.edu>
 	     for pointing this one out.  Layer resize/scale still suffers
 	     from same problem, but Adam's working on L&C at the moment.

	* app/gdisplay.c: off-by one error on bounds check in making image
	     title.

	* app/module_db.c: some would consider it foolish returning to
 	     code you've just unloaded.  So don't do that.

	* app/plug_in.c: when superceeding a PDB function with a newer one
	     of the same name, remove pointers to the old one from the
	     plugins that originally registered them.  Fixes Nick Lamb's
	     pluginrc file corruption thing, and catches the (common?)
	     error of copying a plugin to a different name but failing to
	     change what it registers.  Also, if registering a file
	     loader/saver, make sure it has set an extension, prefix, or
	     magic number it's interested in - that way code that relies
	     on checking this doesn't get confused.

Sat Feb 13 19:05:16 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/internal_procs.c
	* app/parasite_cmds.h
	* app/parasite_cmds.c
	* app/gimpparasite.h
	* app/gimpparasite.c
	* app/gimage_cmds.h
	* app/gimage_cmds.c
	* app/gimpimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/drawable_cmds.h
	* app/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/gimpdrawable.h
	* app/gimpdrawable.c
	
	Added parasite_list functions for global parasites, drawables and
	images as internal (C) and pdb functions.

Wed Feb 10 23:44:00 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: provide a simple way to change the 
	image_title_format string
	* app/scale.c: also update the title when using the zoom tool

Mon Feb  8 18:47:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/feedback.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachblocks.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachshadows.pl: Updated version
	information on my Gimp-Perl plugins that were improved by Marc
	Lehmann so I can keep track better.

Mon Feb  8 19:17:58 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/layer.c
	* app/selection.c: Turn off a layer's bounding box when
	it is deselected.

Mon Feb  8 12:12:18 CST 1999 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c: applied patch from Shuji Narazaki 
	  <narazaki@gimp.org> which adds bezier stroke.

Sun Feb  7 22:06:04 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/dialog_handler.c
	* app/fileops.c: Various bugfixes and speedups w.r.t.
	thumbnail loading.  Now has a 'generate thumbnail' button.

	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/curves.c
	* app/hue_saturation.c: Changed some gint to gint32.  It
	doesn't matter right now, but it might if the optimized
	CLAMP0255 gets fixed.

Sun Feb  7 18:29:26 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: A unidirectional error-spread makes
	the saddest little thumbnails taste full of country
	goodness.

	* app/appenv.c: Wow, CLAMP0255() has a bug that I can't
	quite see, or my compiler does.  Worked around it.

Sun Feb  7 15:04:23 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: More robust and kickin' thumbnail support.

	* app/edit_selection.c app/layer.c app/layer.h: Working
	on lazy opaque layer moves.  Disabled for now.

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.h
	* app/image_render.c
	* app/tile_manager.c: Errr, I don't remember.  No, seriously.
	Nothing of consequence.

Sun Feb  7 02:44:44 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: fix setting of $localedir, and use $CONFIG_SHELL
	to run config.status (variation upon gimp-joke-990122-1)

	* plug-ins/fp/fp_gtk.c: make label code consistent so we
	don't get confused (gimp-ruth-990131-0)

	* app/app_procs.c: toast stale swap files on startup

	* app/general.[ch]: removed prune_filename

	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay_ops.c
	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/patterns.c: s/prune_filename/g_basename/

Sat Feb  6 18:16:57 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: gdisplay_format_title now parses a format string
	      set by the user to control what goes in the image window
	      titles. 
	* app/gdisplay.h: gdisplay_update_title() prototype.
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h: image-title-format added.
	* app/scale.c: update a display's title when zooming in/out
	
	* gimprc.in: sample image-title-format setting

Sat Feb  6 16:22:36 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-
		plug-ins/plugindetails/plugindetails.c
		app/devices.c

	Tidy up of plugindesc UI. Can now resize correctly.

	Fixed problem with session saving. If the active dialog 
	was not one on the toolbox (eg Histogram) then an error would
	be produced the next time gimp is run up.

Sat Feb  6 15:11:26 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpset.c
	* app/gimpset.h: remove the member_modified hacks
	* app/module_db.c: make module_info a proper object emitting a
	    modified signal.

1999-02-05  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/clone.c: merged the registered clone option from the
 	hollywood branch.  Made the source for unaligned clones reset
 	after each stroke.  Make sure we don't crash if the source
 	drawable gets destroyed.

Thu Feb  4 17:22:25 EST 1999 Peter Teichman  <pat4@acpub.duke.edu>

	* app/convolve.c: added pressure support for the Convolve tool

Wed Feb  3 18:12:19 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.2 release

	* configure.in: add plugindetails

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: add shared lib deps for glib/gtk

	* libgimp/gimpmatrix.c: use sizeof(GimpMatrix) instead of
	sizeof(double)*9, memcpy in gimp_matrix_duplicate instead
	of nested for loop

Thu Feb  4 00:23:26 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Tried again to add the plugin dir & files.

Thu Feb  4 00:07:13 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am

	New plugin located in plug-ins/plugindetails. Allows you to browse
	the plugin menu system.

Wed Feb  3 23:46:12 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: More work on thumbnailing - the
	Load Dialog now knows about thumbnails and shows them.
	Still some UI and code tidy-up remaining.

Tue Feb  2 23:34:37 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/datafiles.c
	* app/docindex.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/palette.c: use g_get_home_dir () instead of getenv ("HOME")

	* app/fileops.c: #warning is a gccism

	* app/invert.[ch]: minor cleanup

	* app/menus.c: more cleanups

	* app/blob.c: even more cleanups

	* libgimp/parasite.c: YACU

	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: CVS libtool 1.2e

	* modules/Makefile.am: use -module and -avoid-version flags

	* lic/Makefile.am
	* mapcolor/Makefile.am
	* xbm/Makefile.am: don't link with libjpeg here

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: new Adrian splash

1999-02-02  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.[ch] app/ink.c: Let the user choose between
	elliptical, square, and diamond shaped brushes for
	the ink tool.

Tue Feb  2 22:25:57 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: GIMP now automagically saves
	xv-compatible thumbnails upon image save.  More
	work soon.

	* app/fileops.c: Disabled gimage_set_save_proc()
	call which was causing files to continue saving
	in the same format regardless of the user's selected
	format.  Needs attention.

Tue Feb 02 20:58:40 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_set_name): Fix adding of
 	numbers after drawable copies. We used to get pairs of duplicates
 	after adding the same name several times. Thanks to Piet van Oostrum
	for reporting and diagnosing this.

1999-01-31  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/color_balance.c: optimized by using a lookup table
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: parallelized apply_mask_to_region, 
	combine_mask_and_region, and initial_region.  Use rand_r
	if we are multithreaded.

Sun Jan 31 18:02:46 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.c: Merged in changes from gsumi. This
	revision replaces the unstable conic-tracing code
	with old-fashioned floating point trig calls to
	compute the ellipses.

Sun Jan 31 19:42:26 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/tile.c, app/tile_manager.c:

	Fixed the tile-corruption bug which has been around
	since early GIMP-1.1.  When dirtying a copy-on-write
	tile, a pointer to nonsense data was being returned
	when the c-o-w'd tile source was swapped out to disk.
	Now the c-o-w'ing routine ensures that the tile data
	is correctly locked into memory before duplicating it
	for dirtying.

Sun Jan 31 17:13:46 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-

	* app/plug_in.c

	A mysterious semi-colon crept in....

Sun Jan 31 16:51:18 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Fix segfault when combining very
	tiny inten_a_inten_a regions (ie. when painting).

Sat Jan 30 23:51:04 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-

	* app/dialog_handler.c
	* app/dialog_handler.h
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/plug_in.h

	Fixed problem with TAB key hiding all dialogs. With some WM
	you could hide all the windows with TAB then close the last image
	down... opps how do you get back to the main dialog. Main 
	dialog is now poped up when last image is closed and we had
	used TAB key to hide it.

	New PDB functions to query plugin info. Plugin to follow...

Sat Jan 30 23:47:37 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/menus.c (menus_init_mru): Don't g_snprintf into a NULL pointer.

Wed Jan 27 21:52:43 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/scale.c: oops - should use the image resolution, not the
	    screen resolution.  D'oh!

	* app/gimpdrawable.c: only merge shadow image if there actually is
	    one.

	* plug-ins/emboss/emboss.c: small optimisation: use
 	    gimp_drawable_mask_bounds() to calculate only the pixels that
 	    are actually in the selection.

Wed Jan 27 12:25:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sbjurges@gimp.org>
	
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/add-bevel.scm: fixed the SF-ADJUSTMENT
	so that it shows up again.

Tue Jan 26 22:17:57 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/blob.c: s/(NONE|LEFT|RIGHT)/EDGE_$1/g to clear up namespace

	* app/menus.c: create dummy var to i18n File/MRU item
	(gimp-joke-9901122-1.patch)

	* app/tips_dialog.c: #include <config.h> (gimp-joke-9901122-1.patch)

Mon Jan 25 20:40:26 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* user_install: create modules/ directory in user's ~/.gimp-1.1 dir
	* app/install.c: include description of ~/.gimp-1.1/modules, plus
	    scroll info back to top when done inserting text since it
	    looks nicer.  Also make window that holds result of running
	    user_install a little larger so we see all messages at once.

	* app/gdisplay.h: FUNSCALE_{X,Y} macros for floating point
	    unscales.
	* app/scale.c: show rulers in real-world units (inches/cm/pixels)
	    if dot-for-dot is turned off, plus smoother ruler updates by
	    using FUNSCALE so we don't jump in pixel steps at high
	    magnification factors.
	* app/interface.c: don't set the ruler metrics for now - it's
 	    easier to do the calculations in pixels.  Need to rethink this
 	    a little anyway.

	* docs/parasites.txt: added jpeg parasite info.

Sat Jan 23 20:36:06 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/color_select.c: don't try and gdk_window_get_size() when we
	    haven't been realised yet.

	* app/gimpset.[ch]: allow the use of GTK_TYPE_NONE for storing
	    sets of things that aren't GTK_OBJECTs.  Set can also emit new
	    signal "member_modified" when gimp_set_member_modified (set,
	    ob) is called.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: show main dialog shell last, to avoid ugly
 	    window manager interaction.

	* app/module_db.c: can now handle not having any modules at all
	    without segfaulting, plus proper updates on changes.  Also now
	    has refresh button to re-scan the filesystem for modules.

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: added module_unload() function.
  	    Still needs someone to spruce up the UI.  Volunteers?

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/select_to_image.scm: create display
 	    for newly duplicated image, otherwise you don't see anything.

Sat Jan 23 18:43:23 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c: Multi-line comments, a little more
	sanity-checking.
	
	* app/convert.c: Cosmetic changes to the warning about having
	too many colours for saving transparent/animated GIFs.

	* app/gdisplay.c: Titlebar is correctly updated upon revert.

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Minor improvement.
	
	* docs/parasites.txt: Minor amendments.

	* plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: Minor code comment amendments.

1999-01-22  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/pixel_region.c, app/pixel_region.h: new function 
	pixel_regions_process_parallel
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: use pixel_regions_process_parallel in 
	combine_regions.  fixed bug in combine_inten_a_and_inten_a_pixels
	
	* app/gimprc.c, app/gimprc.h, app/preferences_dialog.c: added 
	num-processors variable

	* config.h.in, configure.in, acconfig.h: add configure option
 	--with-mp and define ENABLE_MP.
	
Thu Jan 21 22:58:00 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: new splash, from Shaw Terwilliger
	<sterwill@io.nu>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: turn DITHER_MAX on

Thu Jan 21 15:16:18 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/bucket_fill.c: correct typo in pdb invoker

Thu Jan 21 14:01:35 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: friggin C++ comments

Wed Jan 20 22:19:54 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.1 release

Wed Jan 20 20:45:23 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* HACKING: updated

	* configure.in: version number bump to 1.1

	* plug-ins/deinterlace/Makefile.am: don't list files from other
	directories

1999-01-20  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Satisfy a more pedantic `automake'.
	* plug-ins/blur/Makefile.am (blur_SOURCES): Don't list files from
	other directories.
	* plug-ins/borderaverage/Makefile.am (borderaverage_SOURCES): 
	Likewise.
	* plug-ins/emboss/Makefile.am (emboss_SOURCES): Likewise.
	* plug-ins/hot/Makefile.am (hot_SOURCES): Likewise.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-examples/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DATA): Remove
	spurious variable.
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DATA): Likewise.
	* plug-ins/webbrowser/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DATA): Likewise.

	Clean up handling of `tools/gcg' (partly due to a more pedantic
	automake).
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Emit tools/Makefile.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove @GCG@, add `tools'.
	* tools/Makefile.am: New file.
	(SUBDIRS): Conditionally build `gcg' subdir.
	* app/Makefile.am (GCG): Work for srcdir != builddir.
	(GCGMAKEDEPEND): Likewise.
	
Wed Jan 20 19:57:34 EST 1999 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* app/gradients.c
	  app/menus.c: 
	  s/gtk_check_menu_item_set_state/gtk_check_menu_item_set_active/
	  configure.in: upped gtk+ requirement to 1.1.13, since that's
	  where it first occurs.

Thu Jan 21 00:10:33 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: Backed out last change for now, since I'm a
	coward and yosh was threatening to make a release...!

Wed Jan 20 22:37:13 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: Enabled the gimage->projection copy-on-write
	hack for RGBA/GRAYA single-layer images.  Masks/channels
	probably don't show yet when this is active.  Report strangeness.
	Thanks.

1999-01-20  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: connect the destroy signal of images to
 	lc_dialog_update_cb

1999-01-19  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/brush_select.c: make the edit button active if the default
 	brush is a generated brush.  Make sure brush spacing >= 1.0
	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: do not add a brush to the brush list if it
 	failed to load
	* app/gradient.c:  Fix typo that caused a crash with --no-data
	* app/main.c: be more forgiving of fp rounding in gserialize tests

Mon Jan 18 23:36:57 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: include module browser, plus re-instate the 'swap
	     colors' and other options that got killed by mistake.  Clean
	     up the odd extra separator too.

	* app/color_notebook.c: hide newly created colour selectors so we
	     know the GIMP one will be the default page.

	* app/module_db.[ch]: NEW FILEs: module database / browser.
	* app/Makefile.am: add module_db.[ch] stuff
	* app/app_procs.c: initialise the module_db
	* app/commands.[ch]: callback to create a module browser.
	* app/plug_in.c: move module loading out to module_db.c
	* libgimp/gimpmodule.h: API change: module_init() should return
	     additonal info (author, purpose, date, etc.)   Also optional
	     module_unload() function.
	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c: add module info, plus an unload function

	* modules/Makefile.am: build triangle colour selector module
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: NEW FILE: colour selector from 
	     Simon Budig <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>.

	* MAINTAINERS: changed my email address

Mon Jan 18 22:55:19 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c app/gimpimage.h:

	Part one of an effort to allow a one-layer gimage
	to share tiles with its own projection courtesy of
	copy-on-write, where sane.  This can save megabytes
	when working with such images.

	The code is 'mostly working' rather than 'perfect',
	so it's disabled until I have time to finish it.

Mon Jan 18 18:56:05 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: Better guess at how PSD files store
	Guide position precision.

Sun Jan 17 22:42:26 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h app/gimage_cmds.c:
	
	An image's projection is now copy-on-write duplicated
	upon duplication of the image.  This should save some
	time and memory for 'duplicate'.

	This needed a new function which is prototyped in gdisplay.h:
	gdisplays_finish_draw() which completes all outstanding
	idlerendered-projections (we don't want to c-o-w an
	incomplete projection).

	* app/interface.c: #include "dialog_handler.h"

Sun Jan 17 20:36:45 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c app/gimpimage.c app/layers_dialog.c

	Guides are now duplicated upon image duplication.
	Guides are now scaled upon image scaling.
	Lowering, raising, and renaming a layer now correctly
	mark the image as dirty.

Sun Jan 17 18:28:58 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c app/paint_funcs.c: Fixed a thinko/bug
	in the recent optimizations.

Sun Jan 17 16:56:25 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c app/bucket_fill.c app/convert.c app/crop.c
	app/cursorutil.c app/cursorutil.h app/dialog_handler.c
	app/dialog_handler.h app/fuzzy_select.c app/gdisplay.c
	app/gimage_cmds.c app/gimpimage.c app/scroll.c
	app/transform_core.c app/xcf.c

	Hourglasses also apply to all registered dialogs.  Hourglasses
	added in a couple more important places.  New hack lets
	hourglasses be added and automagically removed again when
	gimp/gtk re-enters the idle loop.

Sat Jan 16 18:21:58 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@greenend.org.uk>

	* plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: re-wrote the gimp-comment stuff so it
 	works with older libjpeg libraries without cinfo.marker_list
 	support.  While there, added support for loading and saving
 	resolution info.

1999-01-15  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Updated gtk_toggle_button_set_state() to
	gtk_toggle_button_set_active() in all the files.

Wed Jan 13 16:12:35 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/colormaps.c
	* app/devices.h
	* app/tips_dialog.h: minor cleanups

	* app/gimpimage.c: the dirty/clean handling seemed weird, and wasn't
	correct in all cases. Just do a straight increment/decrement to
	try to fix it.

Thu Jan 14 00:02:56 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h
	* config.h
	* configure.in: check for progressive mode in libjpeg

	* plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: applied a patch from 
	Pete <pwhiting@fury.ittc.ukans.edu> that introduces comments
	and progressive saving for JPEGs

	
Tue Jan 12 23:25:46 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: doh, we build tool menus on the fly

	* configure.in: add nl.po to ALL_LINGUAS

	* acinclude.m4
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: upgrade to libtool 1.2d (with fixes for irix6 and osf)

Mon Jan 11 18:11:32 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c: small patch from Nick Lamb that
	does "The Right Thing (TM)" for RGB tiff images

Mon Jan 11 17:30:06 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* commands.[ch]
	* fileops.[ch]
	* gdisplay.[ch]
	* menus.c: implemented File->Revert

Mon Jan 11 22:02:10 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c:
	The bottleneck combine_inten_a_and_inten_a_pixels()
	function is a couple of times faster when there is a
	layer mask, for the common case, due to working with whole
	word-aligned ints where feasible instead of a char at a time.
	The same optimization could be implemented in lots of other
	places, but I'm going to bed.  Good night!

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: #include "cursorutil.h"

Mon Jan 11 21:35:44 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: build the Makefile in the modules directory

1999-01-10  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Use `test -f' instead of `test -e'.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Generate `plug-ins/perl/*' after `plugins/Makefile',
	so that the `plug-ins' directory exists before the `mkdir
	plug-ins/perl' is executed.

Sun Jan 11 00:24:21 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@greenend.org.uk>

	Bit of a large checkin this - it's basically three things:
	  1 - GimpModules using gmodules to dynamically load and
	       initialise modules at gimp start of day.
	  2 - Color selectors now register themselves with a color
	       notebook.
	  3 - progress bars have been cleaned up a bit, so now have
	       progress indictations on all transform tool and gradient
	       fill operations.  Not done bucket fill, but that seems to
	       be the next candidate.

	New directories:
	* modules/: new directory for dynamically loadable modules.

	New files:
	* modules/.cvsignore
	* modules/Makefile.am
	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c: GTK color selector wrapped up as a
	    color selector the gimp can use.

	* app/gimpprogress.[ch]: progress bars within gimp core, either as
	    popups, or in the status bar.  This is mainly code moved out
	    of plug-in.c

	* app/color_notebook.[ch]: color selector notebook, implementing
	    very similar interface to color_select.h so it can be used as
	    a drop-in replacement for it.

	* libgimp/color_selector.h: API color selectors need to implement
	    to become a page in the color_notebook.

	* libgimp/gimpmodule.h: API gimp modules need to implement to be
	    initialised by gimp at start of day.

	Modified files:
	* Makefile.am: add modules/ to SUBDIRS
	* libgimp/Makefile.am: install gimpmodule.h and color_selector.h
	* app/gimprc.[ch]: recognise module-path variable.
	* gimprc.in: set module-path variable to something sensible
	    (currently "${gimp_dir}/modules:${gimp_plugin_dir}/modules").
	* app/Makefile.am: build color notebook and gimpprogress
	* app/app_procs.c: register internal GIMP color selector with
	    color notebook.
	* app/asupsample.c: call progress function less frequently for
	    better performance.
	* app/asupsample.h: progress_func_t typedef moved to gimpprogress.h
	* app/blend.c: make callbacks to a progress function
	* app/color_area.c: use a color notebook rather than a color selector
	* app/color_panel.c: ditto
	* app/color_select.c: export color selector interface for notebook
	* app/color_select.h: color_select_init() prototype
	* app/flip_tool.c: flip the image every time, rather than every
	    second click.
	* app/interface.c: move progress bar stuff out to
	    gimpprogress.c.  Make the code actually work while we're at it.
	* app/interface.h: move prototypes for progress functions out to
	    gimpprogress.h
	* app/plug_in.c: load and initialise modules (if possible). Move
	    progress bar handling code out to gimpprogress.c
	* app/plug_in.h: keep only a gimp_progress * for each plugin, not
	    a whole bunch of GtkWidgets.
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/shear_tool.c
	* app/perspective_tool.c: progress bar during operation.
	    De-sensitise the dialog to discourage the user from running
	    two transforms in parallel.
	* app/transform_core.c: recalculate grid coords when bounding box
	    changes.  Only initialise the action area of the dialog once,
	    to avoid multiple "ok" / "reset" buttons appearing.  Undraw
	    transform tool with correct matrix to get rid of handle
	    remains on screen.  Call a progress function as we apply the
	    transform matrix.  A few new i18n markups.  Invalidate
	    floating selection marching ants after applying matrix.
	* app/transform_core.h: transform_core_do() takes an optional
	    progress callback argument (and data).
	* plug-ins/oilify/oilify.c: send progress bar updates after every
	    pixel region, not only if they processed a multiple of 5
	    pixels (which was quite unlikely, and therefore gave a jerky
	    progress indication).

Sun Jan 10 23:31:45 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c app/bucket_fill.c app/convert.c app/crop.c

	app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h app/gimage_cmds.c
	app/gimpimage.c app/transform_core.c app/xcf.c:

	Most lengthy UI-blocking operations now put up an
	hourglass so the user can see that GIMP is working.
	Let me know if there are other vital cases.

Sun Jan 10 22:41:51 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	New

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/errorconsole.c

	Can now hide/show all main dialogs using the TAB key in any window.
	However....
	there is a bug in gtk that causes the Gimp the crash if you show
	and then hide a lot of dialogs (eg if you have all dialogs visible
	and press the TAB key repeatedly). I have email-ed an example to
	the gtk bug list.
	Also I can't seem to be able to catch the SHIFT-TAB combination
	(suggestions welcome ;-) so the first press of the tab hide all 
	dialogs the second press reshows only the toolbox and the third
	press reshows all. Comments please if you find this behaviour 
	non-intuitive.

Sun Jan 10 20:13:13 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: 
	Greatly reduced memory requirements for layered image loading -
	we now do just-in-time channel unpacking.  Some little
	cleanups too.

Sat Jan  9 21:24:20 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: rework to do gcg by ourselves

Sun Jan 10 01:43:06 EST 1999  Peter Teichman  <pat4@acpub.duke.edu>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c: didn't realize that there
	were more errors of the same type.. The wrong callback argument
	was being dereferenced for most GtkScale objects.

Sat Jan  9 03:42:30 EST 1999 Peter Teichman  <pat4@acpub.duke.edu>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c (angle_update): fixed a
	segfault.. The wrong argument to angle_update was being dereferenced.

Thu Jan  7 15:45:14 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added pl to ALL_LINGUAS

Thu Jan  7 21:33:39 EET 1999 Lauri Alanko <nether@gimp.org>

	* app/undo.c:

	Redid the indexed palette dialog to not crash, to be a bit more
	usable, and to be a cleaner module. A first shot at using gcg in
	actual practice..

	If something is screwed, let me know!
	
	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* libgimp/gimp.h:

	Now keep a local copy of temp proc names

Wed Jan  6 23:30:03 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	* app/indexed_palette.c

	Fixed crash when image->dialog->indexed palette invoked on
	an RGB image.

Mon Jan  4 23:21:56 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	* app/blend.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c

	A patch from Federico to add a spiral gradient type. The patch
	has been slightly modified to allow both clockwise and anticlockwise
	spirals and the numbers used to represent these types of gradients
	have been made to follow on from currently allocated numbers (I hope
	this will not break any scripts). 

Sun Jan  3 14:40:27 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ps/ps.c: new version

Sun Jan  3 22:18:48 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/palette.c: applied a patch from Michael Natterer

	An attempt at a better/improved palette dialog using a notebook
	style for selection.

Sat Jan  2 15:26:31 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am: use -DREGEX_MALLOC,
	seems to be more portable

	* i18n markings from Daniel Egger (mostly removal of tags around
	PDB stuff), some constification

	* I went on a sprintf pogrom. Use g_snprintf or g_strdup_printf
	where applicable, to prevent overflows, especially with filenames
	and translated strings. suid gimp is now more secure. ;)

Thu Dec 24 01:06:26 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.0 release

Wed Dec 23 17:00:47 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	development release. 

Sun Dec 20 23:34:37 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.c: another patch from Xach. Eek, I should have
	waited for him to finish his changes, but it seems to work 
	correctly now.

Sat Dec 19 15:46:27 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gtk.org>

	* app/brush_edit.c:

Sun Dec 20 00:55:21 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

Fri Dec 18 23:46:11 GMT 1998 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed the palette dialog. New functionality. Better previews.

1998-12-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/xcf.c: fixed bug in the resolution saving code and
	added a sanity check to the resolution loading.

Wed Dec 16 13:27:23 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: removed my_gtk_label_set, since the underlying
	implementation changed. Why was this there anyway?

1998-12-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: fixed a bug in combine_inten_and_inten_a_pixels.
	Use INT_MULT and friends everywhere possible.

1998-12-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* libgimp/gserialize.c
	* libgimp/gserialize.h: Changed the enum values to allow for
 	simpler future expansion.
	
	* libgimp/parasite.c
	* libgimp/parasite.h: s/persistant/persistent/.
 	new accessor functions for parasites.  #defines for new flags.

	* app/paintbrush.c: added timeing code for brush strokes.
  	It is #ifed out, and is only valid for shift clicks.
	
	* app/parasite_cmds.h: fixed a warning
	
	* app/parasitelist.h
	* app/parasitelist.c: added _for_each and _length functions
	
	* app/gimpdrawable.c:  set the dirty flag when adding or removing a
 	persistent parasite
	
	* app/gimpimage.c: set the dirty flag when adding or removing a
 	persistent parasite.  Fixed bug and removed debug statements in
 	merge_down.

	* app/xcf.c: save and load resolution, parasites, and tattoos.

	* app/main.c: updated the deserialize test.
	
	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c
	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c: use PARASITE_PERSISTENT define instead of 1

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.c
	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.h: declare some struct variable as extern.
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: Lots of optimizations aimed at speeding up
 	painting.  Should see a 2-4X speed up on most painting
 	(depending on paint modes, brush size etc.)

	* app/drawable.c: check for NULL drawable in drawable_ID.
  	this stops us from being crashed by ill-behaved plug-ins

Tue Dec 15 16:18:40 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/*: stuff from patches/i18n by Daniel Egger

Sun Dec 13 19:48:50 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.[ch]
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/interface.c: I guess finally we have the coordinates 
	display working with all font sizes and even after scaling the
	image

Sat Dec 12 17:36:51 GMT 1998  Austin Donnelly  <austin@greenend.org.uk>

	* app/interface.c
	* app/gdisplay.c: tweak to make status bar update correctly (most
 	of the time).  As Sven has already noted, there seems to be a GTK
 	bug involved.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: only update the cursor co-ords if we
 	actually know them.  Gets rid of silly (0,0) announcements.

Thu Dec 10 19:09:53 CET 1998 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: check only for "perl", not "perl5.005xx".

	* app/image_render.c
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/magnify.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/scale.c: image rendering now happens with float scale
	factors, independent in X and Y axes.  Turning on dot-for-dot in view
	menu does what gimp always used to do (ie one image pixel becomes
	one monitor pixel).  Dot-for-dot is on by default so people
	shouldn't notice any difference unless they load an image that's
	not at 72 dpi and also turn off dot-for-dot.

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.[ch]
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: new gimprc options
	(monitor-xresolution <float>) and corresponding
 	(monitor-yresolution <float>).  Uglyness in preferences dialog to
	add a "Monitor" page to the notebook, allowing user to set their
	monitor's resolution or take it from the X server instead.  This
	badly needs cleaned up :(

	* plug-ins/newsprint/newsprint.c: oops - this hasn't been working
	for grayscale images since my last checkin.  Now fixed.

Sat Dec  5 02:40:52 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Sat Dec  5 04:27:44 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpentry.[ch]: New files. Adds a new widget 
	that allows to specify lengths in pixels, inches and centimeters.
	It is tested, but not yet used anywhere.  As I don't have the time 
	to finish this now, I add this here for later use or for someone else 
	to integrate it into all gimp dialogs...

Fri Dec  4 01:43:59 EST 1998 Nick Fetchak <nuke@bayside.net>

	* app/crop.[ch]: Added option to crop the active layer only

	* app/drawable_cmds.[ch]
	* app/internal_procs.c: Export gimp_drawable_set_image() to the

Fri Nov 27 17:34:57 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* app/ink.c: Use MAX when combining multiple blobs,
	instead of previous technique.	This gives _much_ 
	better results.

Fri Nov 27 11:45:03 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/devices.c (devices_restore): changed silent return on
	device_info == NULL to a g_warning_if_fail (now that Gtk+ is fixed,
	this case should never happen).

Wed Nov 25 18:37:44 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* plug-ins/gz/gz.c: We don't need GTK+, and we
	don't use GTK_CFLAGS, so don't include <gtk/gtk.h>.

Wed Nov 25 22:26:11 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c (ink_pen_ellipse): Added yet another slider, this time
	for an angle adjustment.

Wed Nov 25 21:41:52 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	down, not when you pick up). Some Gtk 1.0 fixes.

1998-11-15  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/newsprint/newsprint.c
	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c: gimp_image_{get,set}_resolution() calls
	now get and set both X and Y resolutions.  Gimp image struct now
	has two resolution fields, one for each direction.  I've updated
	the two plugins which used the info (TIFF and newsprint).

	* app/rect_select.c: deal with zero-size selections correctly (ie,
	select the whole image but don't show marching ants).

	* app/app_procs.c: sort out colourmap before creating splash
	window, so if we need to install a private cmap then everything
	will use it.

	* plug-ins/newsprint/newsprint.c: delete spurious debugging printf.

	* tiff.c, gif.c, script-fu.c: removed all references to
 	parasite_error() and parasite_is_error().  Enable the
	passing of null parasites in the pdb.  Return a copy of the
	parasite instead of the orginal in all pdb functions.

Wed Nov 11 04:18:57 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: fix buglet with making GLIB_LIBS (shouldn't have
	been tripped, but bug nevertheless)

Wed Nov 11 02:27:46 CET 1998 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_run_procedure2): fixed a memory leak,
	(gimp_destroy_paramdefs) new function.

Tue Nov 10 23:44:07 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpmatrix.[ch]
	* app/transform_core.c: minimal speedup

	* app/scale_tool.c: Use transform_core_do() for scaling too.
	This gives a consistent behaviour regarding the corrective transform
	and seems to be faster anyway...

Mon Nov  9 16:20:33 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/png/png.c: applied gimp-ruth-981108-1, fixes loader for
	some indexed pngs. Also default to level 6 compression, level 9
	compression is cpu hungry and isn't much of a win compared to 6.

	falling foul to previously existing bugs.  It won't win you
	anything though.

Sun Oct  4 21:07:07 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c app/paint_core.c: The paint and ink tools
	are synchronous.

	* app/channel.c app/channel_ops.c app/disp_callbacks.c
	app/floating_sel.c app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h
	app/gdisplay_ops.c app/gimpimage.c app/image_map.c
	app/interface.c app/layers_dialog.c app/plug_in.c app/undo.c
	app/xcf.c:

	Resizing image canvases should be less horrible to look at.
	I've removed the implicit clear of the whole area when a
	window is resized by the user, and clear the exposed area around
	the image manually when appropriate.

	Dialogs which want synchronous updates for previews and
	such use displays_update_now().

	Removed some old debugging nonsense which I don't want any more.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c

	* New libgimp/gimppatternmenu.c

	Pattern dialog can now be controlled via the PDB. New widget (not true
	widget) type added to libgimpui (gimp_pattern_select_widget()). Plugins
	should easily be able to control & select patterns. Script-fu
	updated to use new widget. See the test script for example.


Thu Oct  1 17:10:32 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h: Okay, that didn't
	take quite as long as expected.  This is the first cut at
	a gimp-wide IdleRender in place of the previously synchronous
	displays_update().  A synchronous displays_update_now() is
	implemented for stuff like brushes, but it isn't used right
	now.  (Seems to go pretty well without.)

	I need feedback and (previously nonexistant!) bug reports...
	please. =)

Thu Oct  1 12:44:19 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/floating_sel.c app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h

	Temporarily disabled IdleRender code whilst working
	on a more centralised approach.

Wed Sep 30 10:48:00 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@ou.edu>
	* gimp_tips.txt: Ran it through ispell

1998-09-29  Sung-Hyun Nam  <namsh@lgic.co.kr>

	* po/ko.po: New file with Korean translations (some).
	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added 'ko'

Mon Sep 28 18:08:14 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif.c: Fixed an uninitialized variable bug
	which was making TigerT's gifs blow up.  Sigh!

Sun Sep 27 13:53:03 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Fixed a bug in color_only_pixels(),
	fixed a possible bug in border_region().

Sat Sep 26 20:46:18 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.c app/channel_ops.c app/drawable.c
	app/floating_sel.c app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h
	app/gimpimage.c app/layers_dialog.c app/undo.c:

	Moved the idlerender stuff into gdisplay.c.  Implemented
	idlerender when doing floating_sel->layer, and undoing/redoing
	layer deletion.

	idlerender would be useful in many other places for improving
	interactivity, if it weren't for the following problems:

		* By definition, idlerender doesn't wait for a
		gdisplays_update() call	before starting work - it just
		runs in idle time, which due to CPU contention with
		plugins may not	be genuinely available idle time when
		things are 'noninteractive'.

		* Most GIMP functions don't know whether they're
		being run interactively or not.  idlerender only
		makes sense for interactive work.  This is why
		it is currently only applied to those functions which
		would normally only be activated manually.

		* Mixing idlerender and drawable_update() /
		gdisplays_update_area() calls can lead to a region
		being rerendered twice.

	Hence, some slogwork is needed before idlerender can be
	applied in the more general case.

Sat Sep 26 00:54:14 EDT 1998   Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*gimptool.1: minor update to add info about -strip
	build options.

Fri Sep 25 18:05:39 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: Tied up some loose ends.

Thu Sep 24 12:39:27 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_edit.c: #include <string.h> for memset

	* app/layers_dialog.c:

	Display re-rendering is now handled in an interruptible
	asynchronous idle-threaded, uh, paradigm shift.

	The upshot of this is that fiddling about with layers
	in the layers dialog is now a shipload faster for some
	common operations.

	Still needs to be ratified w.r.t. multiple gimages, but
	it's there.

Mon Sep 21 02:05:50 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool.c: correct test for restoring old foundry in
	callback (from Trent Piepho)

	* plug-ins/gauss_iir/gauss_iir.c
	* plug-ins/gauss_rle/gauss_rle.c: better test for bad values,
	put fix in gauss_rle too

Sun Sep 20 15:52:21 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Upgraded to libtool 1.2b

	* Reversioned libgimp to use gtk-style without a funky soname

	* configure.in: craft GLIB_CFLAGS and GLIB_LIBS

	* Makefile.am (pretty much all of em): changed to use new library
	naming scheme. Only link libgimpui and libgtk et al to the plugins
	that actually need them.

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: corrected typo that resulted in corrupt PDB
	record

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpwire.h
	* libgimp/gimpmenu.[ch]: clean up the callback code

	* Removed unecessary inclusion of gtk headers for plugins that
	don't use em

	* plug-ins/zealouscrop/zealouscrop.c: use gint8 instead of gboolean,
	save some mem

	* plugged some warnings in animationplay, flame, fp, gee, gfig

	* gimptool.in: changes for library reversioning, added --nogimpui
	option for not linking in libgimpui

	* configure.in: added finnish translation

Sun Sep 20 12:57:00 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gauss_iir/gauss_iir.c: Fixed segfault if neither
	horizontal nor vertical was selected (as reported by Marc Lehman).

	libgimp/gimp.h libgimp/gimpmenu.c libgimp/gimptile.c
	plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c

	Infrastructure to allow gimp dialogs to be controlled from plugins.
	Brush dialog can now be invoked multiple times. Dialogs invoked
	via plugins do not control the active brush (dialog only used for
	selections).
	New gimp_interactive_selection_brush() function to popup dialog
	Example of usage in the gfig plugin.
	Other dialogs should be able to use this method of invocation.

Tue Sep 15 21:27:10 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif.c:
	The facility to specify the background colour of
	a transparent/animated GIF for non-transparent
	viewers now works very much more consistantly.
	The only situations in which it will fail to work
	as expected now are those where file size can be reduced
	(abeit not by much, as the plugin is sometimes more pessimistic
	than it need be) by re-using an existing unused colour
	index rather than using another bit per pixel in the
	encoded file.  That will never be an issue with an image
	which was freshly converted from RGB to INDEXED with the
	Quantize option, as that option removes any unused colours
	from the image.

	Let me know if you find the consistancy/size tradeoff more
	annoying than helpful and I can adjust it.  IMHO it is too
	arcane a feature to present to any user as a runtime option.

	* app/ink.c: #include <string.h> for a memset

Mon Sep 14 18:51:54 1998  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c app/gimpbrushgenerated.h

	PDB interface for running arbitrary scheme code

	* app/batch.c: redid batch mode to use script-fu-eval

	* app/main.c: fixed command line parsing for batch mode and
	image loading

Wed Sep  9 03:02:17 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added -std1 check for DU4

	* gimptool.in: added strip options

	* plug-ins/hrz/hrz.c: #ifndef'd NeXT out munmap call

	* plug-ins/maze/maze.c: commented out some debug code differently
	so NeXT compiler won't barf.

	* configure.in
	* po/sv.po: added a preliminary Swedish translation from
	Tomas Ogren <stric@ing.umu.se>

Tue Sep  8 18:28:44 1998  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/brush_generated.c: more carefull when the active brush
	  changes
	* app/docindexif.c: white_space() was ungetch'ing the eof
	  marker which can clear the eof flag on some systems.
	* app/docindex.c: check for ferror()s
	* app/brush_select[ch]: sensitize the edit button iff the
	  active brush is a generated brush.

Mon Sep  7 22:30:53 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c: s/ATEXIT/g_atexit/ to sync with gtk changes

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c: removed unused variable
	declaration

Fri Sep  4 17:48:42 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: Added the ability to load
	Guides info from PSD files.

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: Don't allow careless callers
	to add Guides outside of the image boundaries.

Tue Sep  1 18:32:39 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.1: minor updates to the gimptool
	man page to cover more of the kitchen sink.

	* plug-ins/guillotine/Makefile.am configure.in
	plug-ins/guillotine/guillotine.c plug-ins/Makefile.am:
	New plugin to slice an image up along its Guides.

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: Fixes.

	app/gimpimage.h libgimp/gimp.h libgimp/gimpenums.h
	libgimp/gimpimage.c: Moved the guide PDB functions into
	a more sensible place, made them accessible to plugins
	through libgimp.

Tue Sep  1 01:15:06 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c (paint_mode_menu_get_position): added this
	function to translate layer modes to correct menu positions, this
	is ugly but important until someone rewrites the layers_dialog.

Mon Aug 31 23:32:40 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_remove_layer_mask): add back a call to
	gdisplays_flush that seems to have been lost in the
	objectification.

Mon Aug 31 15:15:01 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/color_select.c (color_select_update_colors): made it use the
	color_area rectangle draw so it dithers.

	* app/color_area.[ch] (color_area_draw_rect): made it draw the color
	rectangle with gdkrgb (so it gets dithered) rather than the
	rectangle drawing primitive.

	* app/gximage.[ch] (gximage_put): made it align dithers

	* app/gdisplay.c (gdisplay_display_area): made it so that the
	gximage_put routine gets dither alignment values

Mon Aug 31 16:51:35 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/internal_procs.c: included in merge down changes

Mon Aug 31 16:33:11 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

 	* app/gimpimage.[ch]
	* app/gimage_cmds.[ch]
	* app/layers_dialog.c: Added merge down procedure, I'm not really
	sure if this behaves the way people expect it to, so please send
	me any comments on what it actually should do.  It also needs a
	little testing, especially the pdb call.

	* app/gimpimage.c: cleaned up Seth's merge commit a little. Also
	changed the mode of a merged layer to normal, as this seems to be
	the proper thing.  Discussion is welcome here as well.

Mon Aug 31 19:16:36 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: I'm pleased to say that lewing doesn't
	want to kill me any more.  Hooray!

Mon Aug 31 18:15:16 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage.h app/gimpimage.c app/gimpimage.h
	app/internal_procs.c app/layer.c app/xcf.c:
	Guide creation/deletion/query is now available as
	PDB procedures.  Not yet directly exported to libgimp,
	and needs to be moved into gimage_cmds.c, but it
	works.

Mon Aug 31 11:35:00 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.c: Applied Zach's fix for layer merge opacity.  I
	still don't really like setting opacity to 100% regardless, but at
	least it looks like it behaves correctly.

Sun Aug 30 19:02:56 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/*/Makefile.am: removed -lc from all Makefiles, since it
	causes weird problems on DU4

Sun Aug 30 16:45:05 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/app_procs.c (app_init_update_status): Instead
	of calling gtk_widget_draw() (which was happening before
	the labels got re-size-allocated), just update the
	event loop so the idle resize/redraw gets run.

Sat Aug 29 15:32:32 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/main.c: quell warning to g_set_message_handler

	* app/about_dialog.c: fix off-by-one error for space for the about
	text

Fri Aug 28 15:56:41 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h
	* configure.in
	* app/main.c: added check for putenv and #ifdefed it's usage since
	NeXTStep is lame

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/main.c
	* app/plug_in.c: conditionally compile shared mem stuff so platforms
	without it can still work

	* plug-ins/CEL/CEL.c
	* plug-ins/palette/palette.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-escp2.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-pcl.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-ps.c: s/strdup/g_strdup/ for portability

Wed Aug 26 16:30:36 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/gradient.c (grad_create_gradient_editor,
	cpopup_create_color_item): Turned on dithering in the previews.

Tue Aug 25 14:55:25 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.in: use LDFLAGS and LIBS for building too

Mon Aug 24 13:41:49 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c (file_save): move the mru and docindex calls to
	before the call to gimp_image_set_filename so that they are still
	accessing valid memory.  Fixes the filename corruption seen in
	these interfaces.
	* app/gimpimage.c: added a warning about the side effect that
	caused the above bug.

Mon Aug 24 09:34:37 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/depthmerge.c
	* plug-ins/fli.[ch]
	* plug-ins/gfli.c: updates from the registry

	* plug-ins/pnm/pnm.c: fix for non-interactive mode

	* plug-ins/fractaltrace/fractaltrace.c: minor code cleanups

Mon Aug 24 09:20:38 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: make xdelta not built by default, so poor users
	aren't confused

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/blob.c
	* app/errors.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c: fixes for glib changes with
	s/g_debug/g_on_error_debug/ and s/g_vsprintf/g_strdup_vprintf/

Fri Aug 21 17:25:34 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: fixed a lingering bug that occured from the
	removal of the id system.  This should fix tigert's save problems.

1998-08-21  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/docindexif.c (create_idea_menu):
	* app/docindex.c (make_idea_window):
		Got rid of the menu bar in the document index.

1998-08-19  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	This is the GdkRgb integration.

	* app/gximage.c (gximage_put): Uses gdk_draw_rgb_image rather
	than gdk_draw_image.

	* app/image_render.c: gutted most of this, as it is now subsumed
	by GdkRgb. In the process, gamma != 1.0 doesn't work anymore.
	Also, speedups are almost certainly possible in a bunch of cases.

	* app/info_window.c (get_shades): compiles and runs, but is
	not functional.

	* app/colormaps.c: gutted

	* app/color_select.c: changed dither to max

	A few things remain: the dithering is _not_ correctly aligned for
	scrolling - looks like I'll need to add some more API to GdkRgb
	for that. The gradient editor needs to be set to maximum
	dithering. I'd like to draw the foreground and background colors
	dithered so they don't quantize so much in 8bpp modes.

Wed Aug 19 21:00:00 PDT 1998 Ray Lehtiniemi <rayl@netrover.com>

	* app/airbrush.c gdisplay.c gimage.h gimpimage.c gimpimage.h
	gimpimageP.h image_render.c indexed_palette.c info_window.c
	layers_dialog.c:

	Remove the distinction between flat and layered gimages.  now
	gimages always allocate a projection, even if there is only a
	single layer.

	Fix some gcc-isms.

Tue Aug 18 15:42:44 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: kludged around the use of the disappearing
	gtk private functions (through the magic of cut and paste ;)

Sun Aug 16 18:48:17 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c (ink_paste): Make sure we check that
	ink_set_paint_area found a valid canvas_buf.

1998-08-16  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/docindexif.c: Fixed up the UI to make the document index
	look a bit more like a dialog.

	* app/docindex.h:
	* app/docindex.c: Just fixed a few small nits.  Might have made
	the document index a bit more robust during gimp crashes.

Sat Aug 15 22:53:36 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c (gdisplay_update_cursor): Make sure we check the
	return value from gimp_image_active_drawable.

Sat Aug 15 19:30:42 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* Makefile.am boundary.h boundaryF.h by_color_select.h
	  file_new_dialog.c fileops.h floating_sel.h gdisplay.h
	  gdisplayF.h ink.c interface.h layer.h layerF.h paint_core.h
	  tools.h toolsF.h: header file tweaks.  Now changing tile.h
	  doesn't force about_dialog to recompile! :)

Sat Aug 15 16:53:45 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/airbrush.c: added a debug warning to a case that previously
	caused a segfault.  This appears to be an xinput related problem
	where more than one button press can occur before a button release,
	so if you see a warning that tells you to contact me, please do.

Sat Aug 15 14:09:12 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/transform_core.c (transform_core_do): Fixed a merge error
	that I missed on the last commit.

	* blend.c boundary.c by_color_select.c channel.c color_picker.c
 	  convert.c drawable_cmds.c file_new_dialog.c flip_tool.c
 	  floating_sel.c fuzzy_select.c gimage_mask.c gimpimage.c

 	  scale_tool.c shear_tool.c text_tool.c tile_manager.c
 	  tile_manager.h tile_manager_pvt.h transform_core.c undo.c xcf.c:

	  Another tile tweak.  This one eliminates tile levels (which add
 	  bookkeeping without being used).  Made copy_region more
 	  intelligent on when to use tile sharing; some changes made to
 	  pixel_regions to facilitate this.  Fixed a refcount problem with
 	  xcf load and probably a few other bugs that I've forgotten
 	  about.  Added a sanity check in set_undo_tiles to help with a
 	  problem larry is reporting with airbrush and xinput.

Sat Aug 15 16:11:07 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* TODO: updated the TODO file
	Well, this is going to be my last commitment to the gimp for a
	few months. Have fun coding, folks! I'm looking forward to see
	a nice 1.2 version out there, when I'm back.

Sat Aug 15 15:27:39 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/info_dialog.[ch]
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/shear_tool.c: We have entries in the info dialog now that
	allow to enter exact values for the transformations and crop.

	* app/transform_core.c
	* app/transform_tool.c: Changed "Clip perspective" to "Clip result"
	and made it available for all transformations.

	* app/rect_select.c
	* app/ink.c: minor cosmetic changes

Fri Aug 14 19:58:13 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* plugins/script-fu/scripts/select_to_brush.scm,
	selection-round.scm,slide.scm,sota-chrome-logo.scm,
	spinning_globe.scm,starburst-logo.scm,starscape-logo.scm,
	swirltile.scm, swirly-pattern.scm, t-o-p-logo.scm,
	textured-logo.scm: wave two of the changes

Fri Aug 14 16:40:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_tool.c
	* app/transform_core.[ch]: Added a "Show grid" toggle. Fixed a
	problem that occured when changing the grid size before the tool
	is created. Don't draw the grid if the perspective trafo is too
	weird.

Thu Aug 13 23:00:39 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts: tileblur.scm, title-header.scm,
	trochoid.scm,truchet.scm, unsharp-mask.scm, waves-anim.scm,
	weave.scm,xach-effect.scm: first wave of scripts to
	use some of the new script-fu options

Thu Aug 13 22:20:06 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_tool.[ch]: minor cosmetic changes

Thu Aug 13 22:16:42 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	Applied the patch from Tor Lillqvist <tml@iki.fi>:

	* app/transform_core.c app/transform_core.h: Further changes in
	the look-and-feel. Now we have a info_dialog window for each
	transformation tool, with an action and cancel button. The use of
	shift-clicking to approve the transform introduced in
	gimp-tml-980724-1 is still there. The old immediate transformation
	on button release is gone.

	For use by the rotate tool we have a center-of-rotation point
	which is draggable. Its coordinates are kept in the TransformCore
	struct.

	As there no longer are several related transformations done after
	each other as in the old look-and-feel, we don't need the _first_
	field in TransformUndo.

	Added the function _transform_core_grid_density_changed_ called
	from transform_tool.c when the grid density spinbutton has been
	changed. The grid is instantaneously redrawn in the new
	density. Neat, huh?

	* transform_tool.c transform_tool.h: More options: a toggle to
	clip the result of a perspective transform, and a spinbutton for
	the rubber-band grid density. The toggle for "new" vs. "old" UI is
	now for "corrective" vs. "traditional" paradigm.

	* rotate_tool.c: Show also the center point coordinates in the
	info dialog. If dragging the center point, update TransformCore
	accordingly. Use the center point coordinates from TransformCore
	where appropriate.

	* perspective_tool.c: Show the transformation matrix in the info
	dialog.

	* undo.c: TransformUndo no longed has the _first_ field, code
	simplified thusly.

Thu Aug 13 20:48:48 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/color_area.c: Add event-masks so the tooltip is shown.

	* app/gdisplay.c

	warnings.

	* app/gimplist.c: Include stdio.h to fix compiler warning.

	Tooltips added to items in device status dialog box.
	Fixed problem with multiple input devices & new dialog.
	Added option to preferences (under session) that allows user to
	always store device status on exit from gimp (default off).
	Fixed problem in color area of toolbar to do the possibility of GC not
	existing when the dialog is refreshed.

	* app/commands.c: include errorconsole.h

Tue Aug 11 23:17:20 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_core.c: Fixed the flip tool so it would operate
	properly even if "New Interface" is selected for the transform
 	tools.

Tue Aug 11 22:41:20 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: Fixed the progressbar warnings and the
	image id in the layers-n-channels dialog.

	opaque.
	* tile_manager.c tile_manager.h: added a public call to invalidate
	a tile
	* blend.c boundary.c by_color_select.c channel.c color_picker.c
	drawable_cmds.c fuzzy_select.c gimpimage.c image_render.c ink.c
	layer.c paint_core.c paint_funcs.c pixel_region.c plug_in.c undo.c
	xcf.c: eliminated references to tile private data
	* ink.c (ink_set_undo_tiles), paint_core.c (set_undo_tiles): used
	tile sharing to replace tile copies for undo tiles

	possible

Mon Aug 10 14:48:20 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* initial merge of the internationalization stuff. It's still
	broken in a couple places, so you're probably better off running
	configure with --disable-nls (gimp-mgomulin-980727-0)

	* app/drawable.c (drawable_fill): added a case for

Fri Jul 24 14:40:55 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c (lc_dialog_create): moved
	gtk_widget_show (lc_shell) so that the layers show up in the

Mon Jul 20 11:07:32 EDT 1998  Matthew Wilson  <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/interface.c: Changed progressbar updaters to work with

	* plug-ins/animationplay/animationplay.c: Adapted
	to use GDKRGB when available - results in improved
	speed and stability.

	* app/session.c
	* app/session.h: GIMP compiles again with the latest
	GTK.  Sven will have to look at this fix, but it seems
	to work.

Sat Jul 18 20:15:59 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: About eight times faster with
	new GTKs, a little faster without.  Less bugs.  PH34R.

	* app/rect_select.c
	* app/rect_selectP.h: Show the selection size in the

	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/ink.c
	* app/paint_core.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Now the perfect-mouse-tracking
	normally enabled by pressing MOD1 is a preferences option,
	and MOD1 inverts the affect.

	* app/ink.c: Mildly tweaked the default brush size/range for
	my own twisted sense of esthetics.  Forgive me.

Sat Jul 18 19:28:53 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: cosmetic change

	adequate but not perfect without the ability to get
	the filesel's idea of its cwd via clean GTK coding.

	* app/convert.c: Minor textual changes.

Fri Jul 17 01:28:30 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Thu Jul 16 16:20:47 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.in: Added --cflags-noui and --libs-noui flags and
	appropriate sed junk to craft it. Don't call gtk-config unless
	GTK_CONFIG is set; hard code the info. Strip out redundant
	stuff from the output

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: make gimp_image_flatten return a value
	to be consistent with the PDB

Thu Jul 16 13:13:23 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* updated MapObject again

Thu Jul 16 04:38:19 PDT 1998 Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* brush_edit.[ch]: added a zoom indicator on the preview

	* gimpbrushgenerated.[ch] gimpbrushlist.c: added support
	for loading generated brushes.

	* data/brushes/round01.vbr: a sample generated brush

Wed Jul 15 22:06:32 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* Cursor location in statusbar
	* Fixed resize of window
	* progressbar is smaller now

Thu Jul 16 02:43:51 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

Mon Jul 13 22:49:15 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: check for inline by ourselves if it's not
	defined in glibconfig.h. So inline works if glib is compiled
	with a different compiler than gimp. The plug-ins that use
	inline #include "config.h" now (blur, destripe, emboss,
	gfli, nlfilt, ps, randomize, sinus, and zealouscrop)

	* app/main.c: applied gimp-kc-980707-0; fixes command line
	parsing

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/dbbrowser_utils.c: searching by name does
	- <-> _ translation

	* Added filter pack plugin

Mon Jul 13 22:00:31 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.c : argh, s/snprintf/g_snprintf

Mon Jul 13 19:07:43 EDT 1998  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/3dTruchet.scm
	 plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/flatland.scm
	 plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/truchet.scm:
	updated these scripts to return the display they open,
	mainly so i can use them in another script

Mon Jul 13 17:48:21 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.[ch]: applied gimp-chap-980709-0
	from  Chap Lovejoy  (chap@cc.gatech.edu)

	From the README:

	Adds fixed size and fixed ratio rectangular selections to the
	gimp.

	Fixed size is enabled by filling in the height and width boxes in
	the rectangular selection tool options box and checking the
	"fixed size" checkbox.

	Fixed ratio is enabled by enabling fixed size (set the height and
	width to the desired ratio values) and holding shift after
	starting the selection (holding shift while starting the selection
	will change the selection operation to add).

Tue Jul 14 00:26:49 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c
	* app/menus.c

	* app/convert.c: July 6th's patch from Yasuhiro SHIRASAKI for
	constraining custom-palette choices to <=256 colours broke
	the automatic defaulting of 'Web' palette.  Fixed.

Sun Jul 12 23:56:35 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_swap.c: #if 0'd some of mkj's last commit because it's
	busted.

Sun Jul 12 19:00:15 EDT 1998 Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com>

	* app/tile_swap.c
	* app/tile_swap.h
	* app/tile_manager.c
	* app/tile_manager.h
	* app/pixel_region.c
	* app/pixel_region.h: asynchronous swapin on systems with
	pthreads.  This version is not at all tuned, and the only
	interface which makes use of it now is
	pixel_region_{g,s}et_{row,col}.  Other functions which
	know ahead of time the area that they will be needing can
	request that it be asynchronously swapped in via the
	pixel_region_get_async() function.

Sun Jul 12 17:32:24 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_cache.c: Some optimizations and bugfixes relative to

	* gimplist{.c,.h,F.h,P.h}
	New class for lists

	* gimpbrushlist.h gimpbrushlistF.h gimpbrushlistP.h brush_select.c
	split gimpbrushlist.h into 3 files.  Made gimplist
	the parent class of GimpBrushList.

	* gimpbrushlist.c: brushes in the list are once again sorted by name.

	* paint_funcs.c: minor speed tweak to a minor speed tweak in
	border_region

Sat Jul 11 22:15:31 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.in
	* app/app_procs.c

	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/session.h
	* app/tools.c: More session-managment functionality. Opened dialogs
	are saved and eventually reopened. Try to use the --restore-session
	command-line option. The format of gimprc and sessionrc have
	slightly changed. You should remove your sessionrc and delete the
	line (save-window-positions-on-exit) from your gimprc to avoid
	warnings.

Sat Jul 11 12:20:50 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_manager.c: Removed #include <stdio.h>

Sat Jul 11 08:58:49 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/paint_core.c (paint_core_get_orig_image): Fixed a really
	dumb bug.  (This may solve some of the undo-related crashes.)

1998-07-11  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c:
 	* app/gimprc.c:
	Added commandline for alternate systemwide gimprc.  Fixed alternate
	gimprc (guess I should have tested a little more).

	crashing with Scott's new tile scheme.

	* app/tile_manager.c:
	Added some sanity warnings.

	* app/xcf.c:
	Fixed copy-on-write tile loading which was causing crashes
	with Scott's new tile scheme.  Ref balance count seems funny
	still.

1998-07-10  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/docindexif.c: New file.
	* app/docindexif.h: New file.
	* app/docindex.h:
	* app/docindex.c: Lots of changes.  Added docindexif.c and
	docindexif.h as an interface between the document index and the
	application.  This way the document index can be used in two
	applications and updated in both at the same time.  Also, made the
	document index save files even if it's not shown on the screen.

	* app/Makefile.am (gimp_SOURCES): Added docindexif.c and docindexif.h.

Fri Jul 10 01:44:29 PDT 1998 Jay Cox <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* paint_core.c paint_core.h gimpbrushlist.h gimpbrushlist.c

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c app/gimpbrushlist.h
	  the New files replace the functionality of brushes.[ch]
	  and objectify the brushes.  The basic structure is in

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/menus.c (toolbox_entries): Made it so that you won't get two
	document indexes open at the same time.  (docindex.c assumes that
	you only have one open.)

	* app/docindex.h: Added a function to close the document index
	from outside docindex.c.

	* app/docindex.c: Got rid of warnings about isspace().
	(create_idea_toolbar): Got rid of the warnings about pixmaps.

	from outside docindex.c.
	(idea_hide_callback): Made this function work correctly if called

	* app/app_procs.c (really_quit_callback):
	(app_exit): Made it so that the document index saves even if you
	quit without closing it.

	* app/fileops.c (file_save): Made Save As add to the document index.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

 	* pixel_region.c plug_in.c tile.c tile.h tile_cache.c tile_manager.c
 	* tile_swap.c transform_core.c undo.c xcf.c: split off tile_pvt.h
	from tile.h so changes in the tile implementation don't force a
	complete recompile.

	since the code doesn't handle it (from Yasuhiro SHIRASAKI)

Mon Jul  6 13:18:12 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* pixmaps.h pixmaps2.h tools.c: splits pixmaps up into two headers
	* tile.c: fixed a doublelock deadlock

	* applied a patch from Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>
	* app/convert.c:  Sucked the warning about
	quantizing to too many colours into a text
	widget embedded in the dialog, improved intelligence of
	dialog to default 'custom palette' selection to 'Web'
 	if available, and in this case not bother to present
	the native WWW-palette radio button. [Adam]

	* app/channel.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimprc.c: some code cleanups

Thu Jul  2 18:10:43 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

Thu Jul  2 11:03:12 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* updated blur, randomize, and exchange plugins (not sure if

	* app/Makefile.am:

 	destroy handlers are added.

Sun Jun 28 19:32:06 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	At quick glance, nothing seems to be broken, but if things weird
	out, blame me.

	Now just the same for layers, channels and displays...


Sun Jun 28 10:08:53 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Sat Jun 27 23:28:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: minor unused variable warning cleanup

	* plug-ins/bumpmap/bumpmap.c: another warning cleanup

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c: time(NULL) instead of time(0)

	* plug-ins/gpc/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/megawidget/Makefile.am: install in $libdir instead
	of $gimpplugindir since they *are* libs. Some archs try to
	exec them, and it barfs

Sun Jun 28 00:23:52 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/tile.c : fix from Scott Goehring for a thread deadlock

Fri Jun 26 17:22:00 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	These really aren't tools.. maybe they should go somewhere
	else?

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c: added gimp_displays_flush

Thu Jun 25 17:25:01 PDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/tips_dialog.c: Moved the (last-tip-shown xx) entry to

	but it works fine without doing so.

Tue Jun 23 23:21:16 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/menus.c: The lc-dialog can now be opened from the
	toolbox-menu. Did that in preparation for auto-opening dialogs on
	start-up.

Mon Jun 22 22:57:00 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* app/eraser.c:  Ack, try to get pressure sensitivity right this time.

Mon Jun 22 22:57:00 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* app/eraser.c:  Added support for pressure sensitive eraser

Mon Jun 22 23:35:52 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/pixmaps.h: Made a new pixmap for the ink tool that fits
	better to the others.

	* app/tools.c: Rough outline of session-managment. A new config
	file 'sessionrc' is written and the position of some windows is
	remembered. Still has some problems (offset by wm decorations).
	Can be switched off in the preferences.

Sun Jun 21 15:16:46 CDT 1998 Larry Ewing <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/pixmaps.h
	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/undo.c: Lots of changes to the way tools are intialized and
	accessed.  All information about a tool type is now contained in a
	single ToolInfo array.  There are still some small issues to
	adress about tool groups and we need some way of getting menu
	ordering/grouping to work better (plug-ins need this too).  There
	is still much to be done, but this is the next in cleaning up the
	tools.

	* app/posterize.[ch]
	* app/threshold.[ch]
	* app/histogram_tool.[ch]
	* app/hue_saturation.[ch]
	* app/levels.[ch]
	* app/brightness_contrast.[ch]
	* app/by_color_select.[ch]
	* app/color_balance.[ch]
	* app/curves.[ch]: Changed the *_initalize function prototypes from
	gpointer to GDisplay, to allow better type chacking and provide a
	uniform interface for all the dialog tools.

Sun Jun 21 15:49:43 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/tools.c (tools_select): Set active_tool before

Sat Jun 20 11:36:16 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am: really add thread support

Sat Jun 20 12:04:41 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile.h: #include config.h so we can tell if we're doing
	threads.  (GIMP's includes are f*ck*d.)

	* app/tile_cache.c app/tile.c app/tile.h app/tile_swap.c: modified
	tile swapping to preswap dirty tiles, using a thread if threads
	are enabled in configure or a gtk_timeout if they're not.  The
	code appears stable but could use improvement.  Be careful when
	working in here; there are four sets of semaphores and getting the
	locking wrong will cause deadlocks or tile corruption.  I'll try
	to write up a document describing what's going on in here sometime
	soon.

Fri Jun 19 16:37:40 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* changes libgimp versioning to gtk-style. Bunch o' Makefile.am
	changes for that

Thu Jun 18 23:11:36 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/ink.c: Shift the range to smaller brushes.
	(1/8 - 25 pixel radius, instead of 1-100 pixels)

Thu Jun 18 18:34:58 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h
	* config.h.in
	* configure.in: added --with-threads (taken from gtk+ configure.in)

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: ugly hack to force libgimpi.a to get
	rebuilt since libgimp.la compilations screws up the deps. Fixes
	relinking on make install.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: other cleanups

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug_in.c: pass INT32 instead of INT8 for gdisp_id since
	that's the correct type

	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c
	* plug-ins/tileit/tileit.c: warning fixups

Thu Jun 18 21:20:12 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	  gtk_container_[dis/en]able_resize()

Thu Jun 18 21:03:33 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/interface.c (create_display_shell): Set the resize
	mode on the statusbar to prevent the window from being
	unnecessarily auto-shrunk.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c (my_gtk_label_set): Removed unused
	function using deprecated gtk_container_need_resize()

Thu Jun 18 16:31:16 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.c: Try to prevent overflows when drawing ellipses)
	(fixes the ink => line bug for big sizes)

	making a preference

Thu Jun 18 00:56:41 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* channels_dialog.c
	* layers_dialog.c: the middle mouse button now pops up the menu
	as well as the third when clicking on the layer/channel. This should
	help users that use a tablet and don't have a right mouse button.

Wed Jun 17 17:47:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: fixed a bug I introduced with the
	new mem_size_unit for the tile_cache_size

	* app/channel.c
	* app/paint_funcs.c
	* app/paint_funcs.h: applied a patch from Jay Cox.
	Reimplements selection_grow, selection_shrink, and selection_border
	using new algorithms.

Wed Jun 17 12:07:44 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.c: default "save_window_positions_on_exit" to FALSE
	until I know why gdk_window_get_position() doesn't work properly
	when the window was never moved

Wed Jun 17 01:56:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: started to implement some sort of
	session-managment; right now it only saves a few window-positions.
	I plan to move the saving out of gimprc into a seperate rcfile

	tile_cache_size entry. Added spinbuttons where appropriate (used
	parts of the patch Nuke <nuke@bayside.net> sent to the list).

Sun Jun 15 00:41:05 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: Table spacings

Sun Jun 14 23:41:17 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in.c: Fixed progress code to account for when
	a plugin gets two progress inits

	* app/interface.c: Fixed table allocation sickness.  Now use
	two tables, and a vbox instead of one table so things don't
	get expanded when they shouldn't.  This (table/table_inner)
	should be merged back to 1.0 tree.  The other resize bug is a
	gtkstatusbar bug.

	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/plug_in.h
	* libgimp/gimp.c: added statusbar and progressbar, which
	the plugins now use if they have a gdisp.  Unfortunately
	this introduces a resize bug I wasn't able to fix
	immediately. ;-(

Sun Jun 14 18:37:06 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.[ch] (blob_bounds): Added new files for
	handling scan-converted convex polygons. (From
	gsumi) (these will be moved out to a plug-in tool directory
	when such a thing exists)

	* app/ink.[ch]: New tool for drawing with a hard-edged
	pressure and tilt-sensitive brush.

Sun Jun 14 16:03:29 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* TODO: cleaned up and expanded the todo

Sun Jun 14 00:50:25 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	parsing

	now uses spinbuttons. I'm still not sure this change is
	for the better, let me know. Pretty heavily based
	on a patch by Nuke Skyjumper <nuke@bayside.net>

Fri Jun 12 14:17:54 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*app/file_new_dialog.c
	app/file_new_dialog.h:
	app/gloal_edit.c:  added behaviour so that the
	new file size will default to the current cut buffer
	if its "fresh"

Thu Jun 11 23:37:06 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimp.m4: .m4 file for autoconf gimptool stuff

Thu Jun 11 00:02:15 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/interface.c (create_toolbox): Create the color
	area before showing the window, so that the window gets
	created at the right size. [ This doesn't actually fix
	much, but it is better to do that way ]

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_origin_button_press):
	Stop signal emission so that button doesn't grab the

	*confiure.in: corrected small type concering jpeg test
	(warning printed out "checking for jpeg.h" instead of
	jpeglib.h)

Mon Jun  8 17:16:22 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_select.[ch]: added a hex triplet to the color

	* plug-ins/maze/maze.c: properly handle INT8 and INT16 types.
	With these two fixes, circuit.scm will no longer crash on
	big endian machines

	Not everythings hooked up yet, but its getting there.

	* app/interface.c: Register private tips for all the tools -
	for use with online help later

	* app/interface.c: changed GDK_IMAGE_NORMAL to GDK_IMAGE_SHARED
	to workaround gtk bug

Fri Jun  5 22:37:40 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/Makefile.am app/app_procs.c app/brushes.c app/commands.[ch]
	  app/disp_callbacks.c app/gdisplay.[ch] app/gimprc.c
	  app/interface.[ch] app/menus.c app/paint_core.[ch]
	  app/paintbrush.c app/palette.c app/scroll.c
	  app/tools.[ch] app/undo.c

	- Added two new dialogs - input devices; (GtkInputDialog)
	  and DeviceStatus - which shows the tool/color for
	  each device.

	- Added device_status_update() call that gets called
	  whenever the tool/color etc. are changed.

	- Added ~/.gimp/devicerc file to store settings

	- Code to draw cursor on canvas for non XFree86 XInput
	  where device can't control cursor and extended input
	  device simultaneously.

	- Changed input handling so that we always use the pointer
	  position from the device, not from gdk_input_window_get_cursor,
	  so that motion and cursor position sync.

	- Various changes so things work with non-integer coordinates

	- Pay attention to pressure and tilt in basic tool support.

	- New paint mode PRESSURE that changes the brush based on
	  the brush pressure

	- Left in a few XInput hacks that should be removed, but I no longer
	  remember what they are.
