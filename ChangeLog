Thu Dec 30 02:34:49 CET 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/gradient.c: Applied patch by Daniel Egger:

        - Simplified the layout of the gradient editor without any visible
          changes
        - Removed save button, because changes are saved in "realtime"
        - Hide the scrollbar when not usable -> prevent user from confusion and
          avoid flickering of the scrollbar
        - Removed out-of-date comments and bugsdescriptions

	* app/menus.c: changed the Stack menu keybindings back to the

	the List also grabs those keys resulting to different behaviour

        * app/clone.c
        * app/paint_core.c
        * app/paint_core.h
        * MAINTAINERS

        MAINTAINERS: Updated my entry (it wasn't there ;)
        app/paint_core.[ch] supplied new PaintTool states to clone_paint_func() so that
        writes of temporary markings made directly to the window are not
        clobbered by buffered writes stemming from gdisplay_flush_xxx()
        routines. clone_tool_paint_func() has been modified to take advantage
        of these new states, retiring bug #2184 in a way that does not change 
        user interface semantics. There are small additions to the PaintCore 
        interface that do not affect clientele unaware of added semantics. 
        These changes are detailed at http://idt.net/~gosgood/gimp-patch/patch03.html.

	gdisplay. Yosh, could you please check that I've fixed it the
	right way?! And while you are on it, wouldn't it be nice if it
	would do something useful??

Wed Dec 22 23:18:48 EST 1999 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* gimp.spec: More portable perl handling.

Thu Dec 23 00:29:27 CET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c

	* app/tools.h
	* app/toolsF.h: moved the xinput_airbrush before the measure tool,
	so it groups nicely with the paint tools. Removed the toolbox_position
	from the ToolInfo structure, since it was never used and added some
	separators into the Tools menu.

Wed Dec 22 22:11:35 CET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* MAINTAINERS: updated my entry and added Mitch

	* app/paint_core.c: Changed the behaviour of the Gradient Brush to
	continue with the end color when using "Once Forward/Backward" modes.
	Isn't that what was wanted in the first place? It feels much more
	intuitive and useful to me. Please complain if you don't like this.

	* po-plug-ins/POTFILES.in: applied a patch to the ImageMap plug-in 
	provided by its author Maurits Rijk <lpeek.mrijk@consunet.nl>.

	Contains some internationalization fixes, compliance to the standard 
	Gimp dialog layout and some minor stuff (like the use of tear-off 
	menus).

1999-12-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Added a special help function which
	shows the help for the active notebook page.

1999-12-18  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: Use g_get_home_dir(). Use
	G_DIR_SEPARATOR. Fix a bug I introduced (for Win32) a week ago.

1999-12-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c: My last change caused a warning. Fixed now.

1999-12-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: reverted the splash back to it's previous state
	(with decoration).

1999-12-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gdisplay_ops.c: Set "allow_grow" to FALSE for "Really Quit?" and
	"Changes were made to ... Close Anyway?".

	* app/gimpui.c: fixed a compiler warning.

	* app/tips_dialog.c: Same as above and did some code cleanup.

	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c
	* app/colormap_dialog.p.h: Allow dragging a color with mouse2
	without changing the active color. Replaced the "index" entry with
	a spinbutton. Code & UI cleanup.

1999-12-18  Shirasaki Yasuhiro  <yasuhiro@gnome.gr.jp>

	* po-plug-ins/POTFILES.in: Added gettext support.

Fri Dec 17 20:29:12 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/edit_selection.c: Fixed a couple of bugs with translating
	the selection mask (move tool, alt-drag):
	
	- Selection mask was being clipped whilst moved around, not just
	  at its final resting place.
        - Selection mask translation was being performed 'live' like the
          opaque moves even though there's simply nothing exciting to see.
	  Now the process is much faster.

	Will remove the edit_selection.c dead-code later if this change
	does not cause new trouble.

1999-12-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimphelp.c
	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/helpbrowser.c

	- Pass the locale to use (currently always "C") to the help
	  browser procedures instead of hardcoding it in the help browser.
	- Wheel mouse support for the help browser.

1999-12-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c: Minor help system fixes.

	* app/gradient.c
	* app/levels.c

	paranoia, some s/<type>/g<type>/, various stuff (didn't change any
	logic).

1999-12-17  Shirasaki Yasuhiro  <yasuhiro@gnome.gr.jp>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Added missing app/xinput_airbrush.c.

	* app/perspective_tool.c: Added _() tag.

	There is may also be pure errors which I hope "you" will
	report to either olof@gimp.org or karin@gimp.org. Please 
	don't report spell, grammatical, etc error at this stage in dev.

	If you have any plans to commit to the help system please write

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c: try to be more sane when xwd fails
	to load the temporary file

	* plug-ins/gap/sel-to-anim-img.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/*.scm: same fix as above and add 
	dots where appropriate

Mon Dec 13 19:25:39 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org

	* app/tile.c 
	* app/tile.h
	* app/tile_manager.c
	* app/tile_swap.c:

	Allocate Tile's array of TileRowHints dynamically.  Make type
	of TileRowHint explicit since it's fairly space-critical.
	Can save several hundred K of memory with this and struct
	changes.

	Added warnings for old basically-untested-or-insane
	paths through the tile referencing code.

	* app/tile_pvt.h: Shrink down and rearrange fields of Tile
	struct to save some space with gcc's padding for most people.

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Use tile_sanitize_rowhints() to ensure
          that rowhints have been allocated before use.

	* app/channel_ops.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/pixel_region.c: Cosmetic, sanity or unfinished debug
          changes (the latter commented out) for fun and reference.

1999-12-13  Shirasaki Yasuhiro  <yasuhiro@gnome.gr.jp>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Added missing app/path_tool.c.

	* plug-ins/common/displace.c
	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c
	* plug-ins/flame/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/spheredesigner.c
	* po-plug-ins/POTFILES.in: Added gettext support.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c: More _() tagging.

	* plug-ins/common/sample_colorize.c: Added missing INIT_I18N*().

Fri Dec 10 23:55:10 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/iscissors.c: fix problem with layers with non-zero offset.

	* app/undo.c: Garry, you missed one "0 -> UNDO_NULL" cleanup :)

1999-12-10  Garry R. Osgood  <gosgood@idt.net>

	* app/undo.c : An inadvertent substitution of UndoTypes LAYER_ADD_UNDO
 	and LAYER_REMOVE_UNDO in undo_pop_layer_mask() and undo_free_layer_mask()
	sanity checks prevented the proper disposal of GimpLayerMasks and 
	associated tile managers and tiles. Changed to LAYER_MASK_ADD_UNDO 
	and LAYER_MASK_REMOVE_UNDO to be consistent with the undo_push_layer_mask()
	function and to invoke proper cleanup and release of retiring alpha layer masks.
	* docs/undo.txt: New file, an overview of undo logic written by 
	Austin Donnelly so that I could write this change log entry with 
	panache and flair. ;)
	* app/undo.c
	* app/undo_types.h
	* app/gimpimage.c : Introduced a new UndoType, UNDO_NULL, which maps
	to zero, introducing that value into the enumerated type and preventing
	strict ANSI compilers from complaining about mixing enumerated and
	unenumerated types. Use the type to signal type unknown/error/untyped
	conditions.
 	Full patch documentation at http://idt.net/~gosgood/gimp-patch/patch02.html
	
1999-12-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: The plugin allocated memory chunks of
	constant size to store strings which are longer when translated,
	causing buffer overflows. Fixes bug #3897.
	Replaced some malloc() and free() with g_*() functions and use
	g_snprintf instead of sprintf.

1999-12-08  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/winprint.c: Fix the handling of stored
	state. Actually use the margins from the Page Setup dialog (just
	the left and top margins currently).

	* plug-ins/common/animationplay.c: Weird include hackery to be
	compilable with current CVS GTk+ (on Win32).

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: With current CVS GTk+, use gdk_parent_root
	instead of gdk_root_parent (Win32).

	* app/makefile.cygwin
	* libgimp/makefile.cygwin
	* plug-ins/makefile.cygwin: Get GDK library from new place.
	
1999-12-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/yes.xpm: Resize it to the same size as "no.xpm" because
	the fileselection switches between them and it looks ugly if the
	widget's padding changes.

1999-12-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c
	* app/menus.c: Wrapped the 'plugin_domains' definition and
	initialization and menu_translate() with '#ifdef ENABLE_NLS'.

	* app/palette.c: Removed another trailing comma from an enum.

	* app/tile_cache.c (tile_idle_thread): Changed tile->swap to
	tile->swap_offset because tile->swap doesn't exist. Note that I
	don't understand at all what's going on there. I commited this
	because (1) this way it compiles and (2) it at least _looks_ like
	the right thing to do. Garry, could you check this please?

Tue Dec  7 15:04:11 CET 1999  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

        * tips/gimp_tips.cs.txt: Added translation.

	variables that made picky compilers complain (still some left...)

1999-12-06  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/anchor.xpm: The Smaller Anchor Icon. Still a bit unpolished,
	but a lot smaller than my previous one.. Sven, like it?

Mon Dec  6 10:38:38 CET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_*_dialog.c: applied a patch from Wolfgang Hofer
	that changes the GAP dialogs to follow the GIMP standard more 
	closely. 

Sun Dec  5 19:21:33 CET 1999  Marc Lehmann <marc@gimp.org>

        * plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Install function names
        with underscores instead of minus signs. Should improve the life
        of almost all other languages.

1999-12-05 Garry R. Osgood <gosgood@idt.net>

	Inaugural checkin: Tile accounting
	* app/tile_cache.c
	* app/tile.c
	
	cur_cache_dirty in tile_cache.c was not being fully updated. Fewer
	dirty bytes were being added to this global than what were being 
	placed on the dirty tile queue. Deductions, however, were correct
	sometimes causing cur_cache_dirty to wrap around zero and become
	large positive. This skewed the number of tiles to be swapped to disk, 
	usually downward, but sometimes dramatically upward.
        active_tile_count, (tile.c) currently a diagnostic counter, was 
	not being decremented when tiles were actually destroyed.  

	Full patch documentation at 
	http://idt.net/~gosgood/gimp-patch/patch01.html#991205-0

1999-12-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c
	* app/menus.c: Define the "plugin_domains" array of strings in
	main.c and use it as external variable from menus.c

	What's missing now is a proper way to let gimp know which
	additional catalogs (perl, python, ...) are actually installed.

1999-12-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: Reorder all menu items under <Image>/Filters which
	were created by plugins, so they appear after <Image>/Filters/Web.
	(this way <Image>/Filters/Toys is always the last submenu)

	* app/palette.c: My last change caused both the normal _and_ the
	small menu to pop up on right mouse click on an already existing
	color. Thanks to Nick for pointing this out.

	Now there is only one menu with "Edit" and "Delete" greyed out if
	the click was outside a valid color square.
	I also moved "New" to the top of the menu because that's how other
	gimp menus look like.

Sat Dec  4 05:30:38 GMT 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org.uk>

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: Move mitch's change so now it
	actually Works For Me (TM)

1999-12-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: Set the clist columns to their
	optimal size.

1999-12-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialog_handler.c
	* app/ops_buttons.h: Removed trailing comma from enums to avoid
	compiler warnings with Irix CC. Fixes bugs #3994 and #3995.

Thu Dec  2 23:49:17 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c

	Fixed bug number #3904. - [gimp-bug] no undo for path strokes.
	Undo menu item is now enabled correctly after the path has been
	stroked.

1999-12-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/palette.c: Enable the popup menu containing only "New" in
	the whole area inside the palette's scrolled window.
	This way you don't have to correctly hit the small line a newly
	created palette consists of.

	* app/gradient.c
	* app/gradient_select.c: Set the "Gradient" clist column to it's
	optimal size but ensure a minimal size, so the column title is
	fully visible with all languages and font sizes.

1999-12-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: Default to "Cancel" in the "Really Quit?" dialog.

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: Call brush_select_[freeze|thaw]_all() from
	brushes_init() and brushes_free(), so refreshing the brushes from
	plugins/scripts is faster.

	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/curves.c
	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/hue_saturation.c
	* app/levels.c
	* app/posterize.c
	* app/threshold.c:
	Reorder the action area buttons: [ "OK" "Reset" "Cancel" ]

	* app/menus.c: Some more cleanups in the menu code. Reorder
	<Image>/Filters/Misc only if it exists. Generalized
	menu_translate() in preparation for correctly supporting catalogs
	which only exist sometimes (like gimp-perl).

	* app/gradient.c
	* app/gradient_select.c: Save some lines of code by using
	gtk_clist_new_with_titles() instead of gtk_clist_new().

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: Code cleanup and made the clist titles
	of the unit selection un-clickable.

Thu Dec  2 01:18:33 MET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/grid.c: more chainbuttons and nicer dialog layout 

Tue Nov 30 21:23:39 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/info_window.c

	Fix crash where display closed & info dialog had not been used.

	Info dialog now has option to follow the mouse movements or

	This dialog still needs some work.

	Undo dialog now obeys the "tab" key in the display.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: factored out a small frame+vbox
	creation function from the huge dialog constructor and did some

Sat Nov 27 04:08:32 MET 1999  Sven Neuman <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c: accidentially replaced "Gradient:" with "Blend:" in

	* app/menus.c: fixed the plugin translation problem (YES!!! :-)
	Mysteriously, using g_strdup() et al. instead of composing the

1999-11-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: Removed the definitions of the tearoff menu items
	and build them on the fly. Added N_()-marked submenus instead so
	they get properly translated. Removed N_() from all separators.

	Hacked menu_translate(): Don't try to translate separators,
	tearoffs and the /File/MRUxx entries. Avoid multiple lookups in
	the "gimp-std-plugins" domain. Translating plug-in menu entries is
	still broken.

	Defined all filter categories for proper translation and a first
	try to order them and to add separators (please comment...).

	New Category /Filters/Web.

	german translations.)

        This does not really solve the bugs (buggy plug-ins will just
        try to open message boxes indefinitely, but it at least makes it

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c
	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.c: a widget shouldn't connect to it's own

	instead.

1999-11-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Reorganized the core menu items (everything except
	<Image>/Filters). Everything is of course trivial to change again,
	so please comment on the new "menu feeling" ;-)

	* app/menus.[ch]:

	- Applied the suggestions collected by Olof.
	- Added "..." to all items which open a dialog.
	- Introduced some additional separators (e.g. in "Dialogs").
	- Reorder some plugins and the color correct tools after
	  initialisation.
	- A menu entry to invoke the tooltips inspector.
	- A debugging menu entry which dumps the menu paths and their help
	  pages (will of course go away when the help sys is consistent).

	There are currently two identical "Help" menus because
	<Toolbox>/Help trashes the menu bar if the toolbox is too narrow
	(gtk doesn't seem to support multi-line menubars, any idea?)

	* app/app_procs.c: call menus_reorder_plugins() after loading the
	plugins to beautify the "Xtns" menu.

	* app/commands.[ch]: reordered some functions to match the new
	menu structure (for easier source navigation) and renamed some to
	be consistent (e.g. all help functions are now called help_*).

	Show/Hide the rulers with ordinary gtk_widget_[show|hide]()
	commands. I've tested it several times and it looks exactly the
	same as the old code which used internal gtk knowledge.

	* app/gdisplay.c: applied the menu changes to
	gdisplay_set_menu_sensitivity().

	* app/gimphelp.[ch]: new public function gimp_context_help() which
	invokes the tooltips inspector. Code cleanup.

	* app/resize.c: changed the dialogs' titles to match the menu entries.

	* app/session.c: renamed the gradient selection cmd callback to be
	consistent with brushes/patterns.

	* app/tools.c: added "..." to the menu paths of the tools which
	have dialogs.

	* app/fileops.c
	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c: added some "...".

	Update of the Xinput airbrush, fixed some bugs.
	It's a bit closer to a real tool now ;-).

	Test it out but be aware that you have to have at least
	a tablet with tilt support. Preferibly you should have 
	a Wacom Airbrush and a patched version of GTK.

	Well it still has preformance problems with big brushes 
	i.e big  virtual height and big tilt.

	All sensitives are not yet implemented, but it starts
	to work like a real airbrush. It's as hard to 
	master as the real thing (beside that your ink will
	not streem).

	PS: There is a lot of printf and experimental code 
	in the tool at the moment please don't remove it.

1999-11-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdnd.c: special handling of a dropped "Standard"
	brush/pattern/gradient because they are not part of their lists.

	* app/clone.c
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c
	* app/paint_core.c
	* app/patterns.h
	* app/patterns_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/patterns.pdb: removed the GimpBrushP and
	GPatternP types and use ordinary pointers instead.

	The following stuff makes the "no_data" behaviour consistent. As a
	side-effect it should make the gimp work when there are _really_ no
	brushes/patterns/gradients.

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c: set the initial brush/pattern name to "No
	Brushes/Patterns available" instead of "Active".

	* app/devices.c: set the device contexts' brush/pattern/gradient
	names if we started with no_data, so we find them on refresh.

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: set the name of the standard_brush to
	"Standard".

	* app/gimpcontext.c: don't replace the current
	brush/pattern/gradient's name if the new one to be set is the
	standard one. Together with the change in devices.c, this ensures
	that we get what is set in devicerc. Minor fixes.

	* app/gradient.c: changed gradients_init() to work like the other
	data init functions. Only insert a default gradient in the
	gradients list when the editor is opened (this means that the
	gradients now behave like brushes/patterns when we start with
	"no_data").
	New function gradient_update() avoids tons of useless redraws of
	all clist gradient previews whenever the gradient editor wants to
	update it's large preview.

	* app/gradient_select.c: don't segfault when the user tries to
	drag from an empty gradient list.

	* app/patterns.c: set the index of the standard_pattern to -1 to
	indicate that it's not part of the pattern list.

Sat Nov 13 18:07:51 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Fri Nov 12 17:23:05 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/unittest/gimpmodule.c : Unit test program for module_db.c and

	* app/module_db.c (module_db_write_modulerc): open file with "wt" so
	it's works on OS/2 and WIN. 
	module_db_write_modulerc() now return TRUE if it succeed.
	Global variable "need_to_rewrite_modulerc" is moved out of the function.
	Logic is still the same and it's tested with unittest/gimpmodule prog..

1999-11-09  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/module_db.c (browser_destroy_callback): Must call
	gimp_set_remove_handler() to remove the browser_info_update
	handler from the GimpSet 'modules'.

	Otherwise if we bring up the module browser, then close it, this
	will call browser_destroy_callback(), which will free the
	'browser_st' struct. Later when we exit the GIMP, the modules will
	be unloaded, which will cause browser_info_update() to be called,
	and passed the pointer to the already freed 'browser_st'. Whoopee.
	Thanks to Electric Fence for pointing this out.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Remove actionarea.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: Change declaration of nonexistent function
	gimp_layer_attach_new_parasite() to declaration of
	gimp_drawable_attach_new_parasite(), which was missing.

	* libgimp/gimpui.def
	* libgimp/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add gimpcolorbutton.

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_lib.c: Use G_DIR_SEPARATOR_S.

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/font_selection.c: When compiling with current
	CVS GTk+ (i.e., on Win32 most likely) use the gdk_font_list_*
	functions instead of Xlib's XListFonts() and XFreeFontNames().
	
	* plug-ins/gdyntext/gdyntext.c: Use G_PI.

Sun Nov  7 18:59:22 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontextpreview.c: delay the showing of the full-size
	    pattern, brush or gradient by 150ms as the brush and pattern
	    selector dialogs currently do.  Also, only generate a "click"
	    event if the user has clicked quickly, ie, the mouse up event
	    came before the timeout caused the popup to be displayed).

	* app/gimprc.c: default image size now 983x857, in an attempt to
	    flush out problems to do with large images, images with
	    incomplete tiles around the edges, and images with
	    width != height.  Non-square pixels and other resolution stuff
	    will come in at a later stage when we've got the first round
	    of problems fixed.

	* app/gradient.c: don't allow two gradients with the same name -
	    replace the first.  Mainly this stops us having two "Default"
	    gradients if you start up with --no-data.

	* app/interface.c: can now create an indicator panel in the
	    toolbox even if we have --no-data, since we have built-in
	    defaults now.

Sun Nov  7 15:41:07 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

Thu Nov  4 00:59:01 MET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven.gimp.org>

	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/patterns.c
	* app/patterns.h: plugged mem-leaks

Wed Nov  3 22:36:21 GMT 1999 Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool.c: tag text undo group with TEXT_UNDO rather than
	    silly EDIT_PASTE_UNDO.
	* app/undo.c: TEXT_UNDO name
	* undo_types.h: new type: TEXT_UNDO, plus fix numbering to make it
	    consistent (overlapping enums are bad).

Wed Nov  3 18:44:50 GMT 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.c
	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c
	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpwrite.c: Update from Alexander Schulz (THANKS!)

1999-11-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paths_dialog.c: connect to the "realize" signal of the
	dialog's top-level eventbox, not the vbox.

1999-11-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/gradient_select.[ch]
	* app/interface.[ch]
	* app/palette.c
	* app/pattern_select.[ch]: allow dragging a brush/pattern/... from
	the selections with mouse2 without changing the active element in
	the dialog.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/color_area.c
	* app/color_panel.c
	* app/color_select.c
	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/gimpcontextpreview.[ch]
	* app/gimphelp.[ch]
	* app/gimpui.[ch]
	* app/indicator_area.c
	* app/interface.[ch]
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/lc_dialog.c
	* app/ops_buttons.[ch]
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/tools.[ch]: wrapped gtk_tooltips_set_tip() with
	gimp_help_set_help_data() and moved it to gimphelp.[ch].

	This should (hopefully) be the final state of the help system. The
	New function allows a "private tip" to be set without a visible
	tooltip. This way the tooltips inspector (shift+F1) can search for
	help data in the parent containers of the clicked widget. E.g. the
	ops buttons in the layers dialog have private tips like
	"#new_layer" which gets composed with the help data of the layers
	dialog notebook page resulting in a complete help path.

	Allow mouse2 for all dnd operations. Mouse1 still works like before.

Tue Nov  2 17:36:21 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/question.xpm: fake one from alt's screenshot since he
	forgot to cvs add

Tue Nov  2 22:50:31 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/undo.h
	* app/undo.c
	* app/undo_history.c
	* pixmaps/question.xpm

	Fixed undo history so it shows a dummy image if the preview
	image has not already been generated. The actual image
	could probably do with an artists hand ;-)
	Also mask operations are shown as such in the previews.

	* app/lc_dialog.c

	Fixed rounding error in preview when width << height.

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c

	Always freeze the undo stack for any of the image export types.
	Anyone know why this was not the case to start with? 

Tue Nov  2 22:40:31 MET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Fonts aren't free'd after
	a gdk_font_load but unref'd of course. I just wonder why this has
	ever worked before...
	This should fix bugs #2554, #2774, #2798, #2963 and #3209. Whee!

Mon Nov  1 09:28:46 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.11 release

Mon Nov  1 13:27:14 MET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/drawable_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: applied (a modified version of) a 
	patch from Garry R. Osgood <gosgood@idt.net> that should fix bug #2202 
	and problems with the Warp plug-in.

	* app/main.c
	* po-plug-ins/POTFILES.in
	* plug-ins/common/mail.c: applied a patch from 
	SHIRASAKI Yasuhiro <yasuhiro@awa.tohoku.ac.jp> that handles i18n issues 
	and fixes a problem in the mail plug-in.
	( Could someone please check if the change to app/main.c is the right 
	  thing to do ?! )

	* po-plug-ins/POTFILES.in
	* plug-ins/common/grid.c
	* plug-ins/gap/iter_ALT/gen/plug_in_grid_iter_ALT.inc: 
	checked in a new version of the Grid plug_in developed by 
	Tom Rathborne <tomr@aceldama.com> and me.

Sun Oct 31 21:51:10 MET 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpcolorbutton.[ch]: new widget which provides a simple
	button with a color preview together with a completely wired 
	gtk_color_select_dialog. Color dnd will be added next.

	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.c
	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.h: cleaned up the code a bit and provided
	a destroy function which takes care of freeing the memory allocated
	for the pixmaps/bitmaps (well at least I hope it does).

	* libgimp/gimpunit.c: some cases were handled wrong in 
	gimp_unit_get_digits().

	* plug-ins/megawidget/megawidget.c: follow the GUI conventions when 
	building the action_area and internationalized the code.

	* plug-ins/common/CML_explorer.c: fixed a typo

1999-10-31  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/about_dialog.c (scroll_text): Add a couple of missing commas
	between names. Add UTF-8 versions of non-ASCII names for the new
	UTF-8 based Win32 GDK.

1999-10-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdnd.c
	* app/undo_history.c: remove the remaining defines of
	GRAD_CHECK_SIZE and include libgimp/gimplimits.h instead.

	* app/undo_history.c: connect to the image's "rename" signal to
	update the window title.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/info_window.[ch]: did the same for the info dialog.
	The info window has to remember the gdisplay to disconnect from
	the image's "rename" signal, so I removed the gdisplay parameter
	from the update functions. 

1999-10-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdnd.c: forgot to set "connected" flag after connecting
	to the dnd signals of a specific widget, so the dnd stuff
	connected to these signals for every dnd data type (resulting ie
	in multiple bucket fills when dropping a color/pattern to the
	canvas).

1999-10-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/lc_dialog.c: removed the GimpImage "destroy" callback
	because we already get notified of this event by connecting to the
	image context's "remove" signal.

1999-10-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/ops_buttons.[ch]: added a private tooltip to the
	ops_buttons structure. Removed ops_buttons_set_insensitive().

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/lc_dialog.c: let the ops button's private tips point at the
	already existing help pages. Minor fixes.

1999-10-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/interface.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/tools.[ch]: namespace cleanups: changed the
	"tools_options_*" functions to "tool_options_*" and prefixed all
	dialog menu callbacks with "dialogs_*".
	Allow dropping a tool to the tool options dialog.

	* app/bezier_select.c: change the active tool using context
	functions.

	* app/dialog_handler.[ch]: replaced the uppercase datatype names
	by standard mixed upper/lowercase ones. Provide a function to
	register the fileload dialog instead of accessing it as global
	variable.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: switch to the move tool using context
	functions. Fixed the drop color/pattern functions to convert the
	dropped thing to the dest. image's color space.

	* app/fileops.c: don't export the fileload dialog as global
	variable but register it with the dialog handler instead.

	* app/paths_dialog.[ch]: replaced all the uppercase struct names
	defined here by mixed upper/lowercase. Introduced a
	"set_menu_sensitivity" function like in layers/channels instead of
	calling single button on/off functions from various places.
	Added a menu entry for "Selection to Path".

1999-10-30  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c: Fix a couple of bugs: Must call
	make_canvas if necessary when handling CreateFontIndirect. Must
	call gdk_gc_set_foreground with the pen colour when handling
	LineTo (strange that this hasn't showed up before). Added lots of
	debugging printouts (behind #ifdef DEBUG).

Sat Oct 30 10:14:35 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* app/fileops.c: Fix #3179 (Revert uses wrong filename)

1999-10-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c: call the PDB callback from the context
	callback because it gets called on every change.

	* app/interface.c: the tool buttons had the wrong private tooltips
	attached.

	* app/gimphelp.c: call the help browser with plug_in_run() instead
	of procedural_db_execute() to make it really ansynchronous.
	Added a GtkTipsQuery tooltips inspector which gets invoked by
	<Shift>+F1. Did some illegal juggling with the tips_query's
	"parent" pointer which may cause problems, so I made the stuff
	disable-able with #ifdef's.
	Is there a proper way to create a tips_query widget without having
	to show it somewhere??

Thu Oct 28 23:22:34 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c

	Fixed memory leak with image is deleted.

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c

	Fixed the way the plugin added layers. Preview stuff does not now
	get corrupted.

1999-10-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gradient_select.h
	* app/gradientP.h: new files. Put the function prototypes from
	gradient_header.h there and renamed them to match the naming
	scheme used elsewhere.

	* app/gradient.[ch]
	* app/gradient_cmds.c
	* app/gradient_header.h
	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/gradient_select_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_select.pdb: separated the gradient
	editor and the selections (no more common variables used).
	Allocate own contexts for each gradient selection. Tweaked the
	code and function names to match the brush and pattern selection.
	Enabled dropping gradients to the editor and the selections.
	Renamed all public functions of the gradient editor (see above).

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/session.c: changed according to the new gradient function
	names and includes.

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select.[ch]: scroll to active brush/pattern if it's
	outside the preview area. Minor fixes/cleanups. Allow dropping a
	brush/pattern.

	* app/color_select.c: prefixed all enum constants with
	COLOR_SELECT_* due to a name clash with the new gradient header
	structure (HUE_SATURATION was defined in both places).

	* app/convert.[ch]
	* app/convert_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/convert.pdb
	* app/palette.c
	* app/palette_entries.h
	* app/palette_select.[ch]: removed the special
	Palette[Entries|Entry]P pointer type.

	* app/devices.c: added gradients to the device status dialog.

	* app/disp_callbacks.[ch]
	* app/gimpcontext.c
	* app/gimpcontextpreview.[ch]
	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]
	* app/indicator_area.c
	* app/interface.c: moved the whole tool/brush/pattern/gradient dnd
	stuff to gimpdnd.[ch] and provide simple functions to connect dnd
	callbacks. All those types are passed as real (cross-application)
	GtkSelections now, so the app-side of gimp<->plugin dnd is done.
	Added dnd for tools.

	* app/tools.[ch]: added a tooltip for all non-toolbox tools
	because the device status dialog displays tooltips for all tools.
	Use the ToolType enum instead of int in the ToolInfo structure.

	* libgimp/gimplimits.h: put the size and color of the transparency
	checks here (rename the file to gimpconstants.h ??)

Thu Oct 28 11:45:29 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/datafiles.h: include <time.h>  for time_t.

Thu Oct 28 00:52:57 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_core.c: remember the drawable we were working on
	instead of relying to gimp_active_drawable ().
	This should fix bug #2381.

Thu Oct 28 00:13:56 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bz2.c
	* plug-ins/common/gz.c
	* plug-ins/common/mail.c
	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c
	* plug-ins/common/url.c: free the string returned by 
	gimp_temp_name() 

Wed Oct 27 22:39:56 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/drawable_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: The PDB procedures 
	gimp_drawable_is_[layer|channel|channel_mask] were not renamed,
	but changed all over the place. This made the rotate plug-ins
	fail.

	* app/procedural_db.c: Spit out a warning if a procedure wasn't 
	found in the PDB. Actually free the hash_table entries on
	procedural_db_free().

Wed Oct 27 13:37:54 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * gimp_parasite_find users where not updated to the new syntax
        everywhere.

Wed Oct 27 20:51:10 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/lc_dialog.c
	* app/selection.c
	* app/color_area.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimage.pdb
	* app/gimage_cmds.c

	General memory leaks cleanups/fixes.

Wed Oct 27 13:05:09 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_main.c
	* plug-ins/gap/gap_range_ops.c
	* plug-ins/gap/gap_range_ops.h: applied a patch from Wolfgang Hofer
	that adapts the GAP to the new gimp_convert_indexed interface

Tue Oct 26 18:58:44 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/xcf.c: add "(GIMP)" to the menu entry for XCF, in an attempt
	to make it clear that it is the native file format.

	* app/gimpcontext.c: correct doubled arg name on arg type addition,
	which was messing up the internal gtkarg hashtable

Wed Oct 27 02:03:47 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/info_window.c
	* app/ops_buttons.c: cosmetic changes

	* pixmaps/*.xpm: cropped most of the icons to their minimum size,
	changed the dropper icon to be the same as the toolbox icon

1999-10-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Put the active tool, brush, pattern and gradient to the context
	and use contexts in most places which have references to one of
	those. This is not _really_ a bugfix-only checkin but solves many
	inconsistencies esp. with the "refresh" functionality and fixes
	some SEGVs e.g. in the device status dialog.
	The UI view should now always be in sync with the internal data
	structures.
	Introduced a hardcoded brush, pattern and gradient, so "no_data"
	should actually work, too.

	New Files:
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/paletteP.h: used by palette_select.c

	Removed Files:
	* app/actionarea.[ch]: now done by gimpui.[ch].

	Modified Files:
	* gimprc.in: use brush and pattern name, not filename for the
	default settings.

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: connect to brush and brushlist signals to
	keep the context up-to-date. Remember the name of the
	active brush/pattern/gradient to find them again after a
	refresh. Provide functions to refresh the pointers of all contexts
	after refreshing or deleting brushes/patterns/gradients.

	* app/context_manager.c: connect to the user context's
	"tool_changed" signal to call the tools_select() function. Update
	the colormap's fg/bg_pixel in "*_changed" callbacks, too.

	* app/tools.c: tool switching is now triggered by the user context.

	* app/app_procs.c: no need any more to call
	get_active_brush/... because the brush/pattern/... init functions
	refresh all contexts after loading the data. Slightly reordered the
	brush/pattern... init/free calls due to the new context stuff.

	* app/color_area.[ch]
	* app/indicator_area.[ch]: removed all update functions and
	connect to the user context instead.

	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/devices.[ch]: allocate a private context for each device and
	removed the update function. Prepared for adding the BG color and
	a gradient to the device status.

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.[ch]: new function
	gimp_brush_generated_delete() to get rid of this in the brush
	selection dialog.

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c
	* app/gimpbrushlist.[ch]: removed the "select", "get_active" and
	the brush select dialog functions, added a function to get the
	hardcoded standard brush, namespace cleanups.

	* app/brushes_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brushes.pdb: use the brush of the current context.

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/brush_select_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brush_select.pdb: allocate a context for brush
	selections which are not the main one. Append the main dialog to
	the list of dialogs. Factored out the preview redraw code to the
	scrollbar update callback. Enabled editing, deleting and
	refreshing brushes in all dialogs. Functions to freeze and thaw
	all dialogs on refresh. All dialogs are now always up-to-date by
	connecting to the brush list signals. Moved the create/free
	functions of the main brush selection to this files.

	* app/gradient.[ch]
	* app/gradient_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient.pdb: grad_get_color_at() now takes a
	gradient as parameter instead of using the current gradient of the
	gradient editor.

	* app/gradient_header.h
	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/gradient_select_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_select.pdb: updates like above.
	(The gradient stuff should really be split up into separate
	gradient, selection and editor files before 1.2)

	* app/palette.[ch]
	* app/palette_cmds.c
	* app/palette_entries.h
	* app/palette_select.[ch]
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/palette.pdb: removed all the get/set fg/bg
	functions and the functions to update the import dialog. All
	changes in all dialogs are now immediately propagated to all the
	other dialogs on screen. Namespace cleanups. The active palette
	will soon go to the context as well.

	* app/pattern_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select_cmds.c
	* app/patterns.[ch]
	* app/patterns_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/pattern_select.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/patterns.pdb: exactly the same changes as for
	the brushlist and the brush selections (except the signal stuff).

	* app/[all files needing a brush/pattern/gradient or switching the
	       active tool]: use context functions.

	* app/convert.c: tweaked the ui to match the other dialogs.

	* app/gimpui.c
	* app/gimpui.h: new functions to create an action area without
	creating a dialog.

	* app/[all files using an info_dialog]: use the action_area
	constructor from gimpui.[ch].
	I also used some gimpui.c functions in various files which reduces
	code duplication and removes some gtk 1.0 artefacts.

	* app/[some files not related to the changes above]: While having
	all the stuff in my emacs I removed dozens of useless includes and
	did some indentation and cleanups (not changing any functionality).

Tue Oct 26 02:49:30 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* plug-ins/common/pix.c: Doesn't actually have ALPHA, so
	change Export call appropriately.

Tue Oct 26 01:57:00 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

        * plug-ins/common/xbm.c: Use gtk_initialized

Mon Oct 25 16:49:19 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: don't free the old filename pointer till we're
	all done, since we might be passed our own filename as a param
	and reference it after freeing. The code didn't heed it's own
	warning ;) (TigerT, this should fix that filename corruption bug)

1999-10-25  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/cursorutil.h: Uncomment the inclusion of gdkcursor.h that
	should happen only with GTk+ 1.3, anyway? Why was it commented
	out?

	* app/tile_swap.c: Close before unlinking on Win32, too.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Updates, sorted.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add the gap and imagemap
	plug-ins. Remove palette plug-in (what happened to it?).

	Portability fixes from Hans Breuer:
	
	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.c
	* plug-ins/gap/*.c: 
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/gimpressionist.c: 
	* plug-ins/common/spheredesigner.c: Ifdefify system-dependent includes.

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Remove an unused variable.

	* plug-ins/imagemap/{imap_csim.y,imap_csim_parse.c}: Use
	<string.h>, not <strings.h>.

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_rectangle.c (rectangle_near_sash): Use
	the & operator for function names to return pointers to them.

	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c (sendBMPToGimp):
	gimp_drawable_flush() should be called before resizing the layer
	and image. Now the snapshot of a window is returned the correct
	size, it's not padded in width to a multiple of four pixels.

Mon Oct 25 18:31:30 CEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

        * pixmaps/raise.xpm
        * pixmaps/lower.xpm: Tigert, are you living upside down? 

Mon Oct 25 11:07:52 CEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gif.c
	* plug-ins/common/tga.c: made the same stupid typo here too 

1999-10-25  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/raise.xpm
	* pixmaps/lower.xpm
	* pixmaps/new.xpm
	* pixmaps/duplicate.xpm: a bit of rework of the icons to 
	make them more consistent, I will also make a smaller and
	less eye-popping anchor icon soon.. (hi Sven) :)

Sun Oct 25 01:58:24 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c: Fix Sven's one-liner (Save now works!)

Sun Oct 24 14:58:25 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpcompat.h: added GIMP_DISABLE_COMPAT_H test, and C++
	guards

	* tools/pdbgen/enumcode.pl
	* libgimp/gimpenums.h
	* libgimp/gimpexport.h: added C++ guards

Sun Oct 24 23:22:09 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimpcompat.h: New file.
        * libgimp/gimp.h: Include it.
        * libgimp/Makefile.am: Add gimpcompat.h.

Sun Oct 24 23:13:26 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimp.h: fixed indentation by special request of Sven.

Sun Oct 24 22:53:17 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/* updated imagemap to version 1.3

Sun Oct 24 16:49:13 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb, all calls: fixed some improperly
        renamed pdb functions, most notably gimp_drawable_color.

Sun Oct 24 22:10:16 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/lc_dialogP.h
	* app/paths_dialog.c: some cosmetic changes. The layers dialog now
	automatically scrolls to keep the active layer in view. This is 
	disabled in the channels dialog until I figure out why it doesn't
	work there.

Sun Oct 24 15:24:15 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpexport.c: get rid of remaining (invisible) layers
	after merging visible layers

	* app/channel_ops.[ch]: applied a patch from Garry R. Osgood that seems
	to fix bugs #2261 and #2382 (crashes when using offset). 
	A few more changes made the dialog actually work...

	* app/ops_buttons.c: plugged a memleak I introduced yesterday

Sat Oct 23 22:26:59 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/gimpui.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/ops_buttons.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c: first approach at making the L&C-dialog smaller,
	nicer and more usable.

	* pixmaps/anchor.xpm: changed the anchor back to the old 1.0 one. This
	change is done only to test the new padding and to reflect the fact
	that we need to overwork the icons. I don't want this icon to stay!!

Fri Oct 22 18:29:14 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/procedural_db.c: db_lookup seems to be used pretty often as a
	sanity check, giving lots of spurious messages. Move the check to
	db_execute

Sat Oct 23 00:02:53 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/procedural_db.c

	Error message output to error console if you atemp to call
	a PDB function that does not exists. Useful ito check if scripts/
	plugins fail for unknown reasons,

Fri Oct 22 15:56:15 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/parasite.pdb: sync the names with the last API
	patch

1999-10-23  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c: Fix handling of ExtTextOut. We didn't
	handle the optional clipping rectangle, and got out of sync if
	there was a such. Ignore the inter-character spacing data as we
	don't have exactly same font metrics anyway. Some mostly cosmetic
	other changes.

Fri Oct 22 20:39:13 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool.c

	Fixed the problem where the border values was been ignored.

Thu Oct 21 21:29:40 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpexport.c: handle CAN_HANDLE_LAYERS_AS_ANIMATIONS 
	correctly
	
	* app/scan_convert.c: trivial optimizations

	* app/nav_window.c: applied the patch from Shuji Narazaki that makes
	the navigation window work with tablets. Fixed some rounding errors
	and stopped the flicker.

Thu Oct 21 14:35:05 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: cleaned up the widget 
	destruction and inserted a few sanity checks. Unfortunately this
	doesn't really solve our problems.

Thu Oct 21 02:08:36 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/xpm.c: fixed a stupid cut'n'paste error I've 
	introduced

Wed Oct 20 15:33:49 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: make it compile

Wed Oct 20 23:08:31 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/nav_window.c

	Now works correctly with non-square pixels. (dot-for-dot off
	and xres != yres).

Wed Oct 20 12:18:12 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/gimp-headers.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/gimp-labels.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/spinning_globe.scm: corrected these
	scripts (gimp-convert-indexed and plug-in-map-object changed their 
	parameters). There's still something severly wrong with Script-Fu...

Wed Oct 20 03:42:08 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>
	
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/pix.c
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/png.c
	* plug-ins/common/psp.c
	* plug-ins/fits/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/fits/fits.c
	* plug-ins/sgi/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/sgi/sgi.c: made more save plug-ins export-aware.
	Hopefully I have converted them all now. If you find one that I 
	missed or experience any problems, please drop me a mail.

Tue Oct 19 17:56:29 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bz2.c
	* plug-ins/common/gz.c: removed some spurious g_asserts, based on
	gimp-narazaki-990928-0.patch

	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: applied gimp-narazaki-990925-0, so we
	don't refer to internal widget data

Tue Oct 19 16:47:40 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: add sk to ALL_LINGUAS, remove
	plug-ins/perl/config.status always at the start

	* tips/Makefile.am: add the ko tips file

Tue Oct 19 21:50:52 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/layer.c

	Fixed rounding error in preview generating code that 
	produced dithering where no dithering should have been!

1999-10-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* gimpcontext.[ch]: changed the "parent context" implementation:

	- Automatically connect/disconnect the "*_changed" signals when
	  changing the parent and when setting the "defined" flag of the
	  attributes.
	- Store the former *_defined booleans in a single guint32.
	- Added generic functions to set the "defined" flags of the
	  attributes and to copy attributes between contexts.

	The contexts now correctly handle disappearing images and
	displays, so we don't have to explicitly reset them any more.

	* context_manager.[ch]: adopted to the changed context
	implementation, connect to the user context's "tool_changed"
	signal to switch the per-tool contexts, don't connect to the
	"removed" signal of the image context.

	* brush_select.c
	* tool_options.c: use LayerModeEffects instead of int when calling
	gimp_context_set_paint_mode().

	* gdisplay.c: no need to reset the active display when deleting it
	because the context connects to the "destroy" signal of the shell
	now.

	* menus.c: a shortcut for the navigation window. Moved
	<Image>/Image/Colors/Desaturate before the separator.

	* tools.c: tools_select(): set the active tool of the user context
	instead of calling a special context manager function.

Thu Oct 19 05:57:10 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

        * app/plug_in.h
        * app/plug_in.c
        * app/fileops.c

	Really fixed #2152 this time. Yosh asked me to rename *_OK as
	PLUG_IN_* so that's also changed this time.

Thu Oct 19 05:30:11 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* app/plug_in.h
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/plug_in.c

	Fixed #2152 and as a side-effect discovered that RGB_IMAGE means
	something quite different for app vs plug-ins. The one in app is
	now called RGB_IMAGE_OK to differentiate them.

	* app/image_new.c: Still using RGB_IMAGE instead of GIMAGE (!)
	
Mon Oct 18 21:24:47 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/edit_selection.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialogP.h
	* app/undo.c
	* app/tools.h
	* app/tools.c

	1) Fixed some problems with the paths tool. Now the tool suboption
	"new point" is selected automatically when appropriate. Eg if you
	have the "add point" suboption selected and click  on a point
	not on the curve the "new point" option will become selected and the
	new point will be added.

	2) The "new point" option is defaulted to on when a new image is
	created	or a new image is selected from the image menu.

	3) Move and flip tool now effect the path if it is locked.

	4) Edit stroke now uses the currently selected tool as it should do 
	when stroking.

1999-10-17  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* plug-ins/common/compose.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/gimpressionist.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/preview.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/presets.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/repaint.c: i18n de-lamerism
	Using _(" OK ") etc gives the translators much extra work...

	* app/about_dialog.c: Fix my name

	* app/menus.c: Change order of resize and scale in L&C&P to match the
	normal image menu

	* po/sv.po: Update
	* po-plug-ins/sv.po: Update

Sun Oct 17 21:28:58 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/iscissors.c: long overdue fix for problem with overrunning
	    buffers in a couple of places.  Should now work with image
	    that are not an exact multiple of the tile size, and cope with
	    moving and adding control point before the curve is closed.
	    This may well fix a number of the bugs people have reported
	    on iscissors.  As of now, I know of no bugs in iscissors - if
	    you find one, I'm interested.

1999-10-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpsignal.[ch]: new GimpSignalType gimp_sigtype_int_int_int.

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: set/get colors as separate r/g/b values
	instead of a guchar[3] array.
	The "[foreground|background]_changed" signal handlers must have
	the following signature now:
	color_changed_callback (GimpContext *, gint, gint, gint, gpointer).

1999-10-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: added the possibility to store the current
	tool, FG/BG color, brush, pattern and gradient, but don't use
	these attributes yet.

	Before replacing the get/set color/brush/... functions with
	context functions, I'll have to change the "parent context"
	implementation to something where the children catch the parent's
	color/brush/..._changed signals.
	Finally, updating the indicator_area, device_status, tool_options
	etc. will be done by connecting to their own context's "*_changed"
	signals, which will be much cleaner than calling the update
	functions from various places.

	(I think this is a "consistency fix", please let me know if you
	consider it a new feature).

Sun Oct 17 00:55:38 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <marc@gimp.org>

        * (221 files): Corrected ~20 pdb function names by choosing the
        class/selector syntax over the various other syntaxes floating
        around. Maybe more to come before 1.2.

1999-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.c: preview_size_to_str() uses the new set of preview
	sizes now.

1999-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: made the "Dialogs" sub-menus of <Toolbox>/File and
	<Image> consistent.

	* app/nav_window.c: wheelmouse support as in the gdisplay shell.

1999-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/pattern_select.c: fixed a SEGV: The "refresh" callback
	should call select_pattern(), not pattern_select_select().

1999-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/channels_dialog.c: applied gimp-gosgood-991011-0.patch, so
	double-clicking on the channel widget pops up the attributes
	dialog again. Thanks for the very detailled documentation of the
	bug (which I tried to fix at totally different places before ;-)

Sat Oct 16 05:48:44 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/compose.c
	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c: use gimp_message where appropriate

Thu Oct 14 13:31:59 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sunras.c	
	* plug-ins/common/xwd.c: changed a few changes I made yesterday...

Thu Oct 14 04:59:11 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Recalculate size of ctree in the
	preferences dialog after adding all the categories.
	This is the real fix for #2508.

Thu Oct 14 04:08:31 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/pnm.c
	* plug-ins/common/sunras.c
	* plug-ins/common/xbm.c
	* plug-ins/common/xwd.c: a step further down on the road to make
	all save plug-ins export-aware

Thu Oct 14 01:00:03 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/guides_cmds.c
	* app/move.c
	* app/undo.c
	* app/undo_types.h
	* app/xcf.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/guides.pdb: a whole lotta guide fixes:
	Guides are now freed on image close; undo should work in all
	cases; resize and scale use undo_groups so all operations are
	undoable in one step; some display probs fixed.

	* plug-ins/common/rotate.c: when rotating an image, rotate 
	the guides too.

	This should fix bug #2608. 

Wed Oct 13 21:37:51 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c
	* app/scan_convert.c

	Fixes to memory problems (use of freed memory references) found
	by running with dmalloc. 

	* app/paths_dialog.c 

	Locking of multiple paths are now displayed correctly in the
	transform tool.
	
Mon Oct 11 02:45:06 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Saving is not implemented, so never add
	PSP to the list of available Save formats

Mon Oct 11 23:50:50 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	[both these are from patches by SHIRASAKI Yasuhiro]

	* app/menus.c: tearoff i18n patch

	* plug-ins/AlienMap/AlienMap.c
	* plug-ins/AlienMap/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/AlienMap2/AlienMap.c
	* plug-ins/AlienMap2/Makefile.am: misc i18n fixes
	
1999-10-12  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c: Don't resize layer, it causes image
	corrruption! (bug in layer_resize?) Slight cosmetic changes.

1999-10-11  Kelly Lynn Martin  <kelly@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* plug-ins/unsharp/dialog_i.c (dialog_ientry_update): removed a
	debugging fprintf

Mon Oct 11 02:45:06 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c:
	There are scrollable widgets in this dialog
	=> GUI 101 - it should be resizable (grow only)

Sat Oct  9 22:23:52 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/by_color_select.c:
	applied a patch from Sam Phillips <sam@usaworks.com> that enables
	color dnd to the by_color_select dialog

	* app/devices.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gimpcontextpreview.c
	* app/indicator_area.c
	* app/interface.c: changed the dnd of the context_preview to follow
	the more generic style of the other dnd types. Now widgets that are
	not themselves context_previews can accept dragged brushes, patterns
	and gradients. The image displays now accepts pattern drags.

Sat Oct  9 14:58:08 EDT 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

        * app/about_dialog.c: added some more folks
        * gimp.1: updated the list of contributors, and
        a few other misc updates.

Sat Oct  9 21:03:08 *EST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/gicon.c
	* plug-ins/common/header.c
	* plug-ins/common/hrz.c
	* plug-ins/common/pat.c
	* plug-ins/common/pcx.c
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: more file plug-ins that make use 
	of the export functionality

Sat Oct  9 15:34:12 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.5.in
	* gimprc.in
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: changed the preview_size settings to be
	a bit more finegrained.

Fri Oct  8 18:29:56 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/film.c: applied gimp-kirchgessner-991009-0, allow
	image ids == 0 and i18n

	* app/gimp.gh
	* app/colormap_dialog.gc: sync with changes

Sat Oct  9 02:59:04 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/undo_history.c: use the preview_size set for the layers dialog
	in preferences -- the size is set at dialog creation time and will
	not be changed

Sat Oct  9 02:04:49 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/undo_history.c: catch another case where a new preview should
	be drawn

	* libgimp/gimpexport.[ch]: add NEED_ALPHA since gpb and gih need it

	* plug-ins/common/aa.c: fixed my last change
	
	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: use the new NEED_ALPHA so gimp_export_image 
	prepares the images correctly

Fri Oct  8 15:04:45 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpintl.h
	* libgimp/stdplugins-intl.h: use G_STMT_START and G_STMT_END for
	multiline #defines

	* plug-ins/AlienMap/AlienMap.c
	* plug-ins/AlienMap/AlienMap2.c
	* tips/gimp_conseils.fr.txt: i18n stuff from David Monniaux

Fri Oct  8 22:00:00 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.in: #define GIMP_HAVE_EXPORT so that authors
	of save plug-ins can check if gimp_export_image is available

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/aa.c
	* plug-ins/common/csource.c
	* plug-ins/common/gbr.c
	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: more file plug-ins that make use of the export
	functionality

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: set the filename of the export preview so
	the user has a chance to realize what happens

Fri Oct  8 18:46:43 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/undo_history.c: fixed scrolling to currently selected row
	and added preview images. 

Fri Oct  8 12:16:05 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/vpropagate.c: don't redefine RGB and GRAY here.
	Cleaned up the code a little while I was on it.

1999-10-6  Simon Budig  <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>
	
	* app/path_tool.h
	* app/path_tool.c
	* app/path_toolP.h
	* app/path_curves.h
	* app/path_curves.c
	* app/path_bezier.h
	* app/path_bezer.c
	
	The Path Tool now implements real bezier curves. Some of the tool
	is still a little buggy, but the basic functionality is there.
	Special features: Click on the curve to modify the curve directly
	without adding anchors. 
	Clicking on the canvas with more than one anchors active or one
	anchor in the middle of the curve active, deactivates all anchors, 
	clicking on the canvas with one anchor at an endpoint of an curve
	active continues the curve, clicking on the Canvas without active
	anchors start a new curve.
	Shiftclick on an anchor toggles the activity of this anchor.
	Shift-Doubleclick on an anchor makes the whole curve active or
	inactive.
	
	API for other curve-types still not stable - sorry, but there are 
	some points I have to sort out.

1999-10-07  Kelly Lynn Martin  <kelly@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* plug-ins/common/autocrop.c (colors_equal): little hack so that
  	  all colors with alpha == 0 compare equal

1999-10-3  Simon Budig  <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>  

	* app/path_tool.h     
        * app/path_tool.c
        * app/path_toolP.h
        * app/path_curves.h
        * app/path_curves.c
        * app/path_bezier.h
        * app/path_bezer.c 
 
        Minor cleanup in the Api (adding init/cleanup functions for the
        curve-type-specific data, extending the on_handler function to
        return a handler ID, so the tool-core can tell path_curve_drag_handle
        which handle gets dragged around)  

        Indentation madness - This must be some kind of infective: Too long
        together with Sven and Mitch :-)                


Wed Oct  6 23:29:53 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/palette.c

	Another attemp at fixing the palette dialog.
	The number of columns are now fixed at sixteen (which 
	means the nicely layed out palettes will be OK).
	Expanding the dialog causes the width of the cells to change
	where as the +/- buttons cause the height of the cells to change.	

Wed Oct  6 15:02:45 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.10 release

Wed Oct  6 14:24:46 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/module_db.c
	* app/plug_in.c: s/G_HAVE_CYGWIN/G_WITH_CYGWIN/

1999-10-06  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: Fix the file_gih_save RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS
	case, initialise pixpipe parameters from the parasite (Hi, Adrian!).

	* plug-ins/script-fu/interp_slib.c: Fix preprocessor syntax error.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc} libgimp/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add new
	object files.

	* libgimp/gimp.def libgimp/gimpui.def: Add new entry points.

	* modules/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add -I path to the common gdk
	directory.

Tue Oct  5 14:02:07 EDT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/iscissors.c: all-singing, all-dancing iscissors.  Now
	    scan converts so you can actually select stuff.  Doesn't leak
	    tiles either.  Still have a problem with occasional segfault
	    and CRITICAL assertion failing on addition of anchor when
	    curve not closed.
	* app/scan_convert.c: add connecting link between blocks of points
	    so we actually have a closed polygon.
	* app/tool_options.c: iscissors has just the standard feather and
	    antialias options now.

Mon Oct  4 19:13:39 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/color_display.h
	* app/gdisplay.c: add bpl param for convert func

	* gdisplay_color.c: guard against head and tail cases in reorders

	* app/gdisplay_color_ui.c: expose_full on all actions, so there is
	immediate feedback. Check for no selection and do nothing on actions

	* app/path_tool.c: #warning is not portable; change to /* XXX: */

	* modules/cdisplay_gamma.c: make it so it actually works properly

Mon Oct  4 21:09:20 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: minor cleanups. fixed up alpha channel
	elimination for RGBA_IMAGE && !config->alpha configuration.
	added option to save data with 1Byte Run Length Encoding, in this
	case the outputted source contains a macro (15 lines), implementing
	an RLE decoder for RGB or RGBA buffers.
	RLE gains us a size decrease of ca. 50% for average images, while
	decoding speed amounts to a few invokations of memcpy().

	NEW FILES:
	* app/scan_convert.c
	* app/scan_convert.h: common code from free_select.c and
	bezier_select.c

	MODIFIED FILES:
	* app/disp_callbacks.c: Fix for bug #2517 - dragging colour swatch
	to image with no layers causes segfault.  Something is
	repainting empty images as white rather than chequerboard as
	well, which still needs fixing.

	* app/free_select.c: move code out to scan_convert.c
	* app/free_select.h: use ScanConvertPoint not FreeSelectPoint
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: ScanConvertPoint again

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/Makefile.am: auto* stuff for helpbrowser

1999-10-04 Olof S Kylander <olof@gimp.org>

	* app/color_cmds.c
	
	removed the bug fix for 2306 and 2208
	It is autogen code so ...

1999-10-04  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tool_options.c: fixed bug #2511

1999-10-04 Olof S Kylander <olof@gimp.org>

	* app/color_cmds.c

	fixed bug report 2306 and 2208

1999-10-04  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tool_options.c: backed out a change from last weekend that was
	never supposed to get into CVS

	* libgimp/gimpexport.[ch]: added a third button.
	Now "Export" performs the conversion, "Ignore" skips it and continues 
	and "Cancel" cancels the save.

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.c
	* plug-ins/common/gif.c
	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c
	* plug-ins/common/png.c
	* plug-ins/common/ps.c
	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c 
	* plug-ins/print/print.c: sync with the new interface.

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c: include script-fu-constants.h

1999-10-03 Olof S Kylander <olof@frozenriver.com>
	
	* app/airbrush_blob.c
	* app/xinput_airbrush.c

	A bit better airbrush. It is still ugly but it now
	looks like airbrush. This is a tool for Wacom 
	tables it is no use to use it with a mouse.

1999-10-03  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: 
	the Makefile.am is autogenerated of course...

1999-10-3  Simon Budig  <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>

	* app/path_tool.h
	* app/path_tool.c
	* app/path_toolP.h
	* app/path_curves.h
	* app/path_curves.c
	* app/path_bezier.h
	* app/path_bezer.c

	Lots of stuff for the bezier-tool which will be also used for the
	interface for the intelligent scissors. I started to factor out the
	formulas for the actual curve type, so it is some kind of independent.
	To try this out simply change the "#if 0" in app/path_curve.c to
	a "#if 1" to handle straight lines instead of strange beziers with
	fixed handles :-)
	The functions in app/path_curves.c implement some kind of
	default-action, where useful. To implement a new curve-type it
	should be sufficient to overload the path_curve_get_point()
   	function. Of course, then the speed is not as performant... :-)

	The API for other types is not yet completely fixed, esp. I'm not
	clear about when to give a Tool* or PathTool* as a parameter.
	But it shows the way I want to implement this. In the next step
	I'll fill the stubs in app/path_bezier.c.

	New handling functions: The Tool detects, when you are over an curve
	and lets you split it there by shift clicking.

1999-10-03  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channel_ops.c: copy resolution and unit information when 
	duplicating an image

	* libgimp/gimpimage.c
	* libgimp/gimp.h: some wrappers for PDB functions

	* libgimp/gimpexport.[ch]: new files
	This fixes a longstanding bug and the MostFAQ: When saving a file,
	the file-save plug-ins can use gimp_export_image() to get the file
	converted to a format they can handle. The conversion is performed
	on a duplicate of the image; the original image stays as is.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpui.h
	* po/POTFILES.in: integrate the new files

	* plug-ins/bmp/Makefile.am

	* plug-ins/common/ps.c
	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c
	* plug-ins/print/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/print/print.c: Use the new export functionality. The other 
	save plug-ins will follow...

1999-10-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c
	* app/menus.[ch]
	* app/plug_in.c: show a help page for all menu entries registered
	by plugins.
	Changed menus_create() to menus_create_item_from_full_path() which
	takes a single GimpItemFactoryEntry instead of an array as
	parameter.

1999-10-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	The GIMP Help System part II: press "F1" while browsing a menu
	to show the help page for the menu entry you're currently over
	with the mouse.

	* app/color_notebook.c: all color selectors have to register with
	a help page now.

	* app/color_select.[ch]: register with a help string. Removed
	the dialog part of the files because it's use was deprecated
	anyway (use color notebooks instead).

	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c
	* app/colormap_dialog.p.h
	* app/palette.c
	* app/palette_select.c: use a color notebook instead of a color
	selector.

	* app/gimphelp.c
	* app/gimpui.c: minor changes.

	* app/gimprc.c: "use help" defaults to TRUE now.

	* app/lc_dialog.c
	* app/lc_dialogP.h: a special help function which shows the help
	for the currently selected notebook page.

	* app/menus.c: some weird code which catches "key_press_event"
	in all menu shells and pops up the corresp. help page for the
	selected item. Embedded the GtkItemFactoryEntry in a new
	GimpItemFactoryEntry to allow a help path to be stored.
	Will be partially exported and moved to gimphelp.[ch] later to
	catch key_press for plug-in menu items (don't try this now ;-)
	Renamed "Channel Ops" under <Image>/Image to "Channels" and moved
	some entries to more useful places.

	function prototype.
	
	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c
	* modules/colorsel_water.c: register a help page.

	* plug-ins/common/compose.c
	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c: changed the menu path.

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/helpbrowser.c: load the help files
	according to the new help file structure.

1999-10-03  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/cursorutil.h app/session.c app/text_tool.c: Change the
	GDK_WINDOWING_* stuff to be buildable with current CVS gtk+ (not
	recommended for X11, but necessary for Win32).

	* libgimp/gimp.c: Undef RGB from <windows.h> on Win32.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc} libgimp/makefile.{cygwin,msc} *
	plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add new files. Small changes for
	current gtk+.

	* plug-ins/common/animationplay.c: Win32 kludges.

Mon Sep 20 18:58:38 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

	* plug-ins/common/png.c: Now PNGs with colormaps and tRNS
	(ie transparency info) load properly. Still convert to RGB for
	the best results. Save support is TODO

Sat Oct  2 14:36:21 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: removed cruft (old test code)
	(run): commented config structure initialization.
	(save_image): put only the file's basename into the C comment.
	feature saving of macros instead of a plain structure, so the
	data can be used for third party structure initialization.

1999-10-01  Kelly Lynn Martin  <kelly@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* po/it.po po-plug-ins/it.po plug-ins/perl/po/it.po
	tips/gimp_tips.it.txt: Update for the it locale from Daniele Medri 
	<madrid@linux.it>

Fri Oct  1 19:05:04 EDT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: Factored out common code from 
	    gimp_image_{raise,lower}_layer and
	    gimp_image_{raise_layer_to_top,lower_layer_to_bottom}.  They
	    now call gimp_image_position_layer() to do the real work.
	* app/gimpimage.h: gimp_image_position_layer() takes extra arg to
	    tell whether an undo should be pushed.
	* app/layers_dialog.c: reposition layer with undo.
	* app/undo.c: new undo type for layer reposition.  Layer rename
	    shouldn't dirty and clean the image twice!
	* app/undo.h: prototype for undo_push_layer_reposition().
	* app/undo_types.h: LAYER_REPOSITION_UNDO type.

Fri Oct  1 15:18:34 EDT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.h: don't want sub-undo type
	* app/gimpimage.c: undo_push_channel() takes ADD or REMOVE type
	* app/undo.c: undo_push_channel() takes type.  More specific
	    CHANNEL_{ADD,REMOVE}_UNDO types.
	* app/undo.h: undo_push_channel() prototype.
	* app/undo_types.h: More specific CHANNEL_{ADD,REMOVE}_UNDO types.

Fri Oct  1 12:46:12 EDT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.in: comment typo fix, plus add %D* to default
	    image-title-format string, so people get a '*' in the titlebar
	    if their image is dirty.
	* app/fileops.c: initialise filename before using it.
	* app/gdisplay.c: empty parameter list () is K&R - should be
	    stronger (void) in ANSI C.
	* app/gimpdrawable.c: gimp_drawable_{dirty,clean} functions
	    removed - no one uses them anyway.  Parasite undo type is
	    proper parasite undo type, not MISC_UNDO.
	* app/gimpdrawableP.h: drawable dirty bit removed.
	* app/gimpimage.c: don't change the resolution if there's no
	    difference from the old one.  Call gdisplay_shrink_wrap() to
	    re-calculate scale factors and refresh the display on
	    resolution change.  Layer undo doesn't have sub-types
	    anymore, uses main UndoType instead.
	* app/layer.h: Remove LayerUndoType
	* app/qmask.c: fix qmask undo so it actually works.
	* app/undo.h: new types for undo_push_layer{,_mask} and
	    undo_push_qmask.
	* app/undo.c: change way group boundaries are represented:
	    each Undo has a group_boundary boolean set to TRUE if this is
	    the start or the end of a group, and the type of the Undo is
	    the group's type.  Within a group, each Undo keeps its own
	    type.  This allows pop funcs and free funcs to do
	    type-specific things (eg needed by layer and channel stuff).
	    Don't maintain per-drawable dirty flags anymore.   Floating
	    sel to layer and layer rename now uses meaningful undo types.
	* app/undo_types.h: more specific undo types:
	    LAYER_{ADD,REMOVE}_UNDO, LAYER_MASK_{ADD,REMOVE}_UNDO,
	    LAYER_RENAME_UNDO, and PARASITE_{ATTACH,DETACH}_UNDO.
	* app/undo_history.c: oops - undo stack was being placed into gtk
	    list in wrong order.
	* app/edit_selection.c: push more descriptive LAYER_DISPLACE_UNDO
	    rather than MISC_UNDO.
	* app/layers_dialog.c: better tagging of undo types

Fri Oct  1 17:14:51 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/unittest/parse_gimprc.c: Add parameters options.

1999-09-30  Zach Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/coolmetal-logo.scm: Reverted the
	gimp-flip change I made that managed to be exactly wrong.

Thu Sep 30 23:06:47 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/paintbrush.c

	Fixed problem with stroking with the paintbrush tool.
	Stroking paths with fade/gradients now works again.
	
1999-09-30  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c (load_image): Better workaround for GDK
	bug (gdk_image_get() sets the bpp field to bits-per-pixel instead
	of bytes-per-pixel).

1999-09-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c: "F1" for the indexed palette dialog.

1999-09-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gradient.c: made the indentation consistent.

Wed Sep 29 22:48:01 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: very minor fix.

Wed Sep 29 21:56:52 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/colourmap_dialog.i.c
	* app/gdisplay_ops.c
	* app/palette.c

	1) Index palette dialog now registered so it gets hidden/shown when
	the "TAB key" is pressed in the canvas window.

	2) When the index palette is modified the changes are now shown
	immediately in all views.

	3) DND now works in the index palette.

	4) OK button when modifying a colour in the index palette 
	dismisses the dialog correctly.
	
	5) DND in the colour palette viewer does not crash when no colours
	are selected.

	6) Corrected a problem with "New View". If your canvas is zoomed in
	and the image is offset in the display and a new view is requested
	the Canvas in the new view is corrupted. This bug is also in
	gimp 1.0.x 
	
1999-09-29  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/iwarp.c: Back out my change of 1999-09-14. It
	changed the semantics of the code, the deform_area_vectors array,
	and the two sequential loops in iwarp_deform() are really needed.
	Sorry. Thanks to Garry R. Osgood for analysing this.

Wed Sep 29 18:40:17 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/undo.[ch]
	* app/undo_types.h: undo for resolution and unit changes. 
	Fixes bug #2434

Wed Sep 29 16:31:04 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/helpbrowser.c: you can now drag the pages
	from the helpbrowser to Netscape, error messages are more verbose 
	and a history bug was fixed

	* help/contents.html
	* help/index.html: explain that these pages are bogus

Wed Sep 29 13:34:26 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap: updated iterator procedure for paper_tile

Tue Sep 28 20:54:45 CDT 1999 James Mitchell <mitchell@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/perl/po/it.po: Added from Daniele Medri <madrid@linux.it>
	240 translated messages, 10 untranslated messages.

Tue Sep 28 16:53:43 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/gimprc.c (parse_absolute_gimprc_file): Move the good code
	from parse_gimprc_file() into the new function called
	parse_absolute_gimprc_file(). 
	This new function is tested with parse_gimprc.
	* app/unittest/parse_gimprc.c : remove unused code.	
	* app/unittest/Makefile.am: Add ../gimpui.o ../gimphelp.o

Mon Sep 27 15:07:03 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c: revert that last set_locale change, it was bogus

	* app/gdisplay.c: don't update menu sensitivities when flushing
	immediately, so that painting isn't slowed by it

1999-09-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimphelp.[ch]
	* app/gimpui.[ch]: new files

	* app/interface.[ch]
	* app/preferences_dialog.[ch]

	The GIMP Help System part 1: Press "F1" in any dialog to pop up
	the help page for this dialog.

	Moved the widget constructors from preferences_dialog.[ch] and the
	query boxes from interface.[ch] to gimpui.[ch].

	The dialog constructors take a help_func and a help_data
	parameter and install the "F1" accelerator which emits the new
	"help" signal.

	The "help" signal callback calls help_func(help_data) which finally
	has to call gimp_help() which in turn invokes the help browser.

	Still have to find a proper way to (1) prevent "F1" being assigned
	to some menu item and (2) to catch "F1" while browsing the menu
	trees in order to pop up the help for the selected item.

	* app/menus.c: a <Toolbox>/File/Help... menu item.
	* app/commands.[ch]: a command callback for the "Help..." menu item.

	* app/gimprc.[ch]: new boolean gimprc variable "use_help".

	* app/info_dialog.[ch]: pass a help function and data to the info
	dialog constructor.

	* app/tools.[ch]: store the tools help page names in the tool info
	structure. Export a special tools_help_func() which shows the help
	page for the active tool.

	* app/[all files calling a dialog constructor]: pass the dialog's
	help page to the constructor.

	Most dialogs are now created by gimp_dialog_new() which also sets
	up the action_area and the WM delete event callback, so I removed
	the resp. code from these files.

	Fixed some minor bugs and did some other stuff but didn't change
	any logic except dialog creation.

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/helpbrowser.c: don't try to call a running
	help browser and don't install any menu path (all done in
	app/gimphelp.[ch] now).

Mon Sep 27 17:13:48 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/unittest/gimpparse.c (global_parse_init): 
	Use parse_add_directory_tokens().

	* app/unittest/parse_gimprc.c: comment out 
	parse_add_directory_tokens(). Test  parse_gimprc() with argc != 1.

	* app/gimprc.c (parse_add_directory_tokens): Add this init function
	to add directoy tokens. Code taken from parse_gimprc ().
	No logic changed, but parse_gimprc () is cleaner.
 	Changes tested by unittest program parse_gimprc.

	* app/blend.c: enable offset for linear gradients

	* paint_core.[ch]: paint_core now knows about the distance in pixels

	* app/unittest/gimpparse.c (parse_gimprc_file2): OS/2 patch.

1999-09-21  Kelly Lynn Martin  <kelly@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* data/brushes/Makefile.am (install-data-local): added an
	install-data-local target to forcibly remove the round1.vbr from
	the installed brushes directory if it's still there for some silly 
	reason...

Tue Sep 21 21:31:23 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c: gtk_timeout and gtk_idle are gunit, so
	make them guints; fixed a warning while I was on it

1999-09-21  Zach Beane <xach@mint.net>

	* app/color_cmds.c:
	Reverted the patch I applied to fix the SOTA-Chrome bug. Yosh says he

	again. Now it mimics the selection tools. Using the <Shift> key
	with the blend tool restricts it to 15 degrees.

Mon Sep 20 23:06:36 MEST 1999  Sven Neuman <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: made the creation of guides undoable.

Mon Sep 20 18:58:38 BST 1999 Nick Lamb <njl195@zepler.org>

Mon Sep 20 12:51:30 EDT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	Honest, guv, it's not a feature - it's a tightly integrated
	package of undo system cleanups and fixes.

	NEW FILES:
	* app/undo_history.c: window showing recent undo (and redo) steps
	    available.
	* app/undo_types.h: broken out of undo.h to fix circular includes.

	MODIFIED FILES:
	* app/Makefile.am: compile undo_history.c
	* app/channel.h: use enum for channel undo type, not just magic
	    numbers.
	* app/layer.h: same for layer undos.
	* app/commands.c: edit_show_undo_history_cmd_callback() function to
	    pull up undo history window.
	* app/commands.h: prototype for above.
	* app/gdisplay.c: make undo / redo menu items sensitive according
	    to whether they would do anything.  Would be easy to change
	    the text to say what would be undone/redone, but I don't know
	    the GTK.
	* app/gimpimage.c: new signal emitted by gimage:
	    UNDO_EVENT. gimp_image_undo_event() function to emit it.
	* app/gimpimage.h: prototype for above.
	* app/gimpimageP.h: pushing_undo_group member is now an undo_type,
	    not an int.  Keep undo history widget here too (if created).
	* app/menus.c: add "Edit/Undo history..." to image menu.
	* app/undo.c: new types: enums undo_type and undo_state rather than
	    ints and magic numbers.  All undo_pop_* and undo_free_*
	    functions made static.  New static function
	    undo_type_to_name().  Issue undo event signals on various
	    important events (eg undo pushed, undo popped etc).
	    undo_push() now takes a "dirties_image" arg to say whether
	    image should be dirtied.  Layer moves now dirty the image.  A
	    couple of g_return_if_fails () on undo_pop and undo_redo to
	    assert we're not in the middle of an undo group.
	    undo_get_{undo,redo}_name() to peek at names of top items on
	    undo and redo stacks resp.   undo_map_over_{undo,redo}_stack()
	    to run a function for each item or group on stack.  Layer and
	    channel undos use symbolic names rather than 0 or 1.  Array
	    mapping undo types to names.
	* app/undo.h: split out undo types to undo_types.h.  Prototypes
	    for functions described above.  undo_event_t enum.
	    undo_history_new() prototype lives here too.

	Random other fixes:
	* app/gimpdrawable.c
	* app/image_render.c: default labels in switches to keep egcs happy.

	* app/nav_window.c: some fixes to (sort of) cope with image res !=
	    screen res.  Still needs work to handle non-square pixels
	    properly.

	* app/paths_dialog.c: bad idea to call gimp_image_dirty()
	    directly.  Even though it's currently commented out.

Mon Sep 20 18:23:18 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* configure.in: Add app/unittest/Makefile

                               (checked in by Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>)

        * app/tools.c
        * app/toolsF.h
        * app/path_tool.c
        * app/path_tool.h
        * app/path_toolP.h

        New tool, should become a replacement for the bezier_select tool.
        This is the start for a more general Path-tool. It will provide
        (sometime :-) functions to manipulate a path, constructed from
        curves (open or closed), which in turn are constructed from segments.

        These segments could be lots of differen types, as a start 
	bezier-curves are planned and Austin Donelly is probably
	interested in using it for intelligent scissors. It will be
	possible to mix bezier- and intelligent-scissors-segments in a
	path - but currently I'm missing for a good UI-Idea.

        This tool is far from complete, currently it is only possible to
        create a single open curve. It is possible to manipulate an anchor 
	by clicking on it and dragging it around. Multiple anchors can be 
	selected by shift-clicking on an anchor. You can drag multiple 
	anchors around.

        The path_tool* files are under heavy construction currently. This 
	is a preliminary checkin to get this in before the
	feature-freeze... ;-)

	NOTE: Simon sent me this patch on Tuesday, I just didn't manage to
	check it in until now... (Sven)
	
Wed Sep  8 23:58:14 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	layer_widget_preview_events

	* app/lc_dialog.c: remove GIMP_IMAGE() cast from the

	the options, that I'm planning to hide for non-xinput devices).

	scaled brushes ...

	to "standard" parasite types. Used for the
	gimp-brush-pipe-parameters parasite that the gpb and psp plug-ins
	handle, and the value of which is stored in gih files, from
	which gimpbrushpipe.c parses it.

	* libgimp/{Makefile.am,makefile.{cygwin,msc}}: Add new files.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Add its entry points.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: Fix cosmetic argument name error.

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: Remove code that previously was copied
	here, use functions from parasiteio.c.

	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: Ditto. Add brush cell width and height
	fields to the gih save dialog. These are now the main entries the
	user should use to adjust how the image's layers are divided into
	brushes. Add some cleverness to update the rows and columns fields
	as cell size is changed. (Still too easy for the user to get
	confused, though.) Display corresponding guide grid on the
	image. Unfortunately, updating the guides doesn't seem to work.

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Use functions from parasiteio.c.

Wed Sep  1 23:18:21 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/interface.c
	* app/nav_window.c
	* app/nav_window.h
	* pixmap/navbutton.xpm (new)

	New popup navigation window. press the icon that appears in  
	the bottom right-hand corner of the image display. A navigation
	window will appear that will allow you to scroll around the image if
	the area shown is smaller than the overall image size. Thanks to tml
	for the idea. 

Wed Sep  1 22:28:09 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gradient.c
	* app/color_transfer.c
	* app/free_select.c
	* app/lut_funcs.c
	* app/blob.c: s/#include <math.h>/#include "libgimp/gimpmath.h"/

Wed Sep  1 21:27:27 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c app/convert.h:
	Optional low-bleed FS dithering

	* app/fsdither.h: Tables are const

	* app/convert_cmds.c app/internal_procs.c tools/pdbgen/enums.pl
	tools/pdbgen/pdb/convert.pdb:
	Clean up 'convert' PDB interface cruft.

1999-09-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/appenv.h
	* libgimp/gimpmath.h: New file. Includes <math.h>. Move G_PI,
	RINT(), ROUND() etc from app/appenv.h here, so plug-ins can
	use them, too. Remove some commented-out old stuff in appenv.h.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: Include gimpmath.h.

	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_main): Win32: Don't install signal
	handlers, we can't do anything useful in the handler ourselves
	anyway (it would be nice to print out a backtrace, but that seems
	pretty hard to do, even if not impossible). Let Windows inform the
	user about the crash. If the plug-in was compiled with MSVC, and
	the user also has it, she is offered a chance to start the
	debugger automatically anyway.

	* app/*several*.c: Include gimpmath.h for G_PI etc. Don't include
	<math.h>, as gimpmath.h includes it.

	* plug-ins/*/*many*.c: Include config.h. Don't include <math.h>.
	Remove all the duplicated definitions of G_PI and rint(). Use
	RINT() instead of rint().

	* app/app_procs.[ch]: app_exit() takes a gboolean.

	* app/batch.c
	* app/commands.c
	* app/interface.c: Call app_exit() with FALSE or TRUE.

	* app/main.c (on_error): Call gimp_fatal_error. (main): Don't
	install any signal handler on Win32 here, either.

	* app/errors.c (gimp_fatal_error, gimp_terminate): Win32: Format
	the message and call MessageBox with it.  g_on_error_query doesn't
	do anything useful on Win32, and printf'ing a message to stdout or
	stderr doesn't do anything, either, in a windowing application.

Wed Sep  1 22:16:41 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_core.c: Only set the defaults for non_gui operations
	if the paint_core is really used in non_gui mode. This fixes a bug 
	that showed up when drawing lines with a pressure-sensitive device.

Wed Sep  1 21:12:42 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c: a small bugfix

Wed Sep  1 20:45:56 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb
	* app/fileops_cmds.c: applied the patch from Wolfgang Hofer that
	should fix the problems saving jpeg with GAP.

	* app/paint_core.[ch]: preview length of brush-stroke in statusbar
	when drawing a line using <Shift>. Do we need the angle here too??

Wed Sep  1 14:12:17 CEST 1999  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

        * po/da.po, configure.in: added danish file from
        Henrik Hansen <hh@mailserver.dk>

Wed Sep  1 13:29:09 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpcontextpreview.[ch]: added gradient preview.

	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/indicator_area.[ch]
	* app/interface.c: display the active gradient in the toolbox.
	
Tue Aug 31 23:13:51 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/tile_swap.c: no leading underscore for S_IFOO constants

Wed Sep  1 00:56:37 EDT 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushpip.[ch]
	* app/airbrush.c

	* app/paintbrush.c: fix pencil tool for use with 
	   pixmaps again 

1999-09-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/tile_swap.c (tile_swap_open): Use _O_TEMPORARY. Removed
	#ifdef, instead define the Win32-only _O_BINARY and _O_TEMPORARY
	as zero if not defined.

	* plug-ins/common/spheredesigner.c: Include config.h (#if
	HAVE_CONFIG_H). RAND_FUNC and SRAND_FUNC are defined in that.

Tue Aug 31 20:21:34 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/Makefile.am: use libgck_la_LIBADD to get
	shared lib deps

Wed Sep  1 02:12:09 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.[ch]
	* app/gimppatternprewiew.[ch]: removed

	* app/gimpcontextpreview.[ch]: new files.
	Merged the preview_widgets into one more generic widget. I'm 
	calling this context_preview since I hope the widgets will
	become useful for the context_manager. I'll add a gradient
	preview soon.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/devices.c
	* app/inidicator_area.c: Use the new gimp_context_preview.

Tue Sep 1  00:19:30 CEST 1999  vidar@prosalg.no  (Vidar Madsen)

1999-08-31  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/spheredesigner.c: Minor portability fixes.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add spheredesigner.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add gdisplay_color_ui.[ch].

Tue Aug 31 14:25:50 CET 1999  vidar@prosalg.no  (Vidar Madsen)

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/spheredesigner.c: Added the SphereDesigner
	plugin.

Tue Aug 31 11:16:52 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c
	* app/gimppatternpreview.c: check if brush/pattern is not NULL

Tue Aug 31 01:13:13 EDT 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>

	* app/pencil.c: add a "Use Pressure" check button to the options
	so that pressure sensitivy can be disabled. Suggested by
	Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>.  

Mon Aug 30 18:56:19 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/apptypes.h
 	* app/pathsP.h: removed trailing enum commas
	
	* app/gdisplay_color.[ch]: added a foreach function to iterate
	over the display filter names

	* app/gdisplay_color_ui.[ch]: display filter ui stuff (doesn't do
	much yet ;)

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: hooked the above into the menu system

	* app/Makefile.am: added new files

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/preview.c: removed bogus // comment

1999-08-30  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c (gimp_brush_generated_save): Save the
	name on a line of its own (as it can contain spaces). Print spaces
	between the floating-point values. (gimp_brush_generated_load)
	Corrspondingly, read the name from a line of its own.
	
	* app/gimpbrushlist.c (brushes_free): Portability fixes. Use
	g_strconcat. Free allocated strings.

	* app/gimpbrush.h (GimpBrushClass): Add a new method, gboolean
	want_null_motion(), that tells if the brush wants to be painted
	when we don't know the direction yet. This is needed (so far) by
	brush pipes that select the brush based on direction.

	* app/gimpbrush.c: Implement above method returning always TRUE.

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: Here, implement it returning FALSE or TRUE
	on whether the brush pipe has any angular (direction) dependent
	dimension or not.

	* app/paint_core.c (paint_core_button_press): Call the method
	if current point == last point.

Mon Aug 30 22:15:29 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/devices.c: use the new [gimp|pattern]_preview_widgets.

	* plug-ins/xjt/xjt.c: correct a gccism

Mon Aug 30 03:37:28 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/brush_edit.[ch]: Allow the user to change a brush's name.

	Williamson's brush saving code from the hollywood branch.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c:  add the brush_vbr_path

	* data/brushes/round1.vbr: removed.  You should remove this file
	from your system if you have installed previous versions.

Sub Aug 29 23:00:50 1999  vidar@prosalg.no  (Vidar Madsen)

	* plug-ins/gimpresionist/*.[ch]: Big rewrite of many internals
	to get rid of the clumsy "struct rgbcolor" construct, as well
	as removal of old and useless debugging code.

Sun Aug 29 20:40:34 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Add include <sys/types.h>.
	
Sun Aug 29 17:54:58 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: *->I: Deterministic colour dithering
	to arbitrary palettes.  Ideal for animations that are
	going to be delta-optimized or simply don't want to look
	'busy' in static areas.  Also a bunch of bugfixes and tweaks.
	No PDB interface to the new features yet, although a
	convert_image2() is ready and waiting.

Sun Aug 29 00:40:20 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.h
	* app/convert.c: *->I: Deterministic alpha dithering over layers,
	reduced bleeding of transparent values into opaque values, added
	optional stage to remove duplicate or unused colour entries from final
	colourmap.

Sat Aug 28 15:36:36 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.[ch]
	* app/gdisplay_color.[ch]: added framework for having multiple
	simultaneous displays

Sat Aug 28 12:15:15 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Sat Aug 28 10:53:17 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb
	* app/layer_cmds.c: don't check name for NULL and fail

1999-08-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_main): Put in a workaround for the problem
	with plug-ins on NT and W2K, where installing the GIMP under a
	directory path with spaces (\Program Files\GIMP) would cause the
	plug-ins to malfunction. Turns out the argv gets set up by the C
	runtime incorrectly in such a case, the path name of the
	executable is split at the spaces. The workaround is to splice
	argv[0] together from the pieces again, shifting the rest of argv
	down.

	* app/plug_in.c (plug_in_open): Correct (harmless) typo in the
	Win32 code.

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c (gimp_brush_pixmap_select_brush): In the
	case of angular selection, offset angle with G_PI/2 to be
	compatible with PSP tubes. Restrict the index of each dimension
	separately to the appropriate range.

	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c (gih_save_dialog): Must not free the combo
	box string list, the strings are not strdup'ed by the combo box.

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c: Put the pasting of a new image
	under File/Acquire.

Fri Aug 27 18:15:33 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay_color.c: more work on the gamma correction stuff

1999-08-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: Implement the selection of brush based on
	cursor direction, pressure, tilt, or a random value. (Hmm, forgot
	velocity, later.) (In addition to just incrementally stepping.)
	Read the brush pipe parameters from the gih file's second line.
	There is no way to tune the parameters in the GIMP, they must
	currently be set when saving the gih file (in the gpb plug-in).
	
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.h
	* app/gimpbrushpipeP.h: Move the PipeSelectModes enum to the
	"private" header. Add a stride array to GimpBrushPipe to make
	indexing easier.

	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: Add selection mode fields to the dialog.
	Attach the pipe parameters entered as a parasite, too.

	* docs/parasites.txt
	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Use "placement", not "spacing" (which
	means another thing).

Fri Aug 27 18:08:55 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_display.h: just include parasiteF.h

Fri Aug 27 15:00:03 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/levels.c: added a small header to the file format

Fri Aug 27 10:57:28 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* user_install
	* user_install.bat: added gimpressionist, levels, and curves dirs

	* app/color_panel.c
	* app/color_select.c
	* app/colormaps.[ch]
	* app/palette.c
	* app/selection.c: remove vestigal colormap code; use get_color
	directly now

	* libgimp/color_display.h
	* app/gdisplay_color.c: bugfixes, added state load/save hooks,
	redid the interface to work on blocks, removed dummy default
	handler, work on gamma correction stuff

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: #include <stdlib.h>

	* app/gximage.c: minor cleanups

	* app/levels.c: default to ~/.gimp-1.1/levels for load/save; minor
	gui prettification

	* app/main.c
	* app/menus.c: plug-in menu translation patch from SHIRASAKI Yasuhiro
	<yasuhiro@awa.tohoku.ac.jp>

	* libgimp/stdplugins-intl.h: add INIT_I18N_UI() for calling
	gtk_set_locale()

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lightin_main.c: use INIT_I18N_UI()

Fri Aug 27 18:57:50 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/nav_window.h
	* app/gimppreviewcache.h
	* app/layer.c
	* app/channel.c 
	* app/commands.c

	Added some controls to the nav window. Yep. I know that the
	buttons are toooo biGGG.

	Preview cache changes. Now prime preview cache with a image
	so that later we have a better chance of a hit. Still
	needs to be more intelligent at doing this (needs to pick largest
	out of the cache & use its size as the size to prime with).
	
Fri Aug 27 02:16:02 EDT 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: paint_line_pixmap_mask, finally
	composite alpha correctly, or at least closer. Should 
	get rid of those annoying artifacts. 

Thu Aug 26 17:17:48 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: use AM_CPPFLAGS instead of CPPFLAGS

	* app/levels.c: added some basic load/save functionality to the levels
	tool. Still needs some polishing.

1999-08-27  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/menus.c: Add Acquire under the File menu.

	* plug-ins/twain: New (Windows-only) plug-in. Interface to TWAIN
	image sources. Written by Craig Setera.

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: Add twain sources to EXTRA_DIST.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Move gimpressionist and twain
	around as they are in this directory now.

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c
	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c
	* plug-ins/twain/twain.c: Put them under File/Acquire.

1999-08-27  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist: added gimpressionist plugin

1999-08-27  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/paint_core.h: Add a flags field and corresponding type
	ToolFlags to PaintCore. The only flag bit defined so far is
	TOOL_CAN_HANDLE_CHANGING_BRUSH, which those tools who don't mind
	if the brush changes while painting (as in the case of pixmap pipe
	brushes).

	* app/paint_core.c: Test above flag before calling the brush's
	select_brush method.

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/pencil.c: Set above flag.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add latest additions.

Thu Aug 26 14:16:12 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.c: #include gimpbrushpipe.h and gimpbrushpipeP.h
	instead of gimpbrushpixmap.h

Thu Aug 26 22:10:11 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <svengimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushpreview.[ch]
	* app/gimppatternpreview.[ch]: new files
	Widgets that handle the complete preview machinery with scaling and
	popups for brushes and patterns.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/inidicator_area.c: Use the new widgets.

	The device-status dialog and the brush and pattern selectors should
	use the new widgets too. Hopefully the GtkLayout widget can handle
	this easily. As I am away till next week, I won't object if someone 
	else gives it a try...

Wed Aug 25 02:40:39 CDT 1999 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/image_new.[ch]: Added new files, the UI independant part of
	  new image dialog.  

	* app/file_new_dialog.[ch]: uses image_new stuff now.  Alot
	  changed.  No UI changed.  Different behavior is a bug, as
	  this is only for UI separation.

	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: Added gimp_image_get_width () and 
	  gimp_image_get_height ().

	* app/global_edit.c: Call a function in image_new instead of
	  file_new_dialog for updating the status of the cut buffe.

Wed Aug 25 17:27:40 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in
	* gimptool.in: install a gimpinstall script (basically install-sh)
	for platforms without an install tool

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: correct some gccisms

	* plug-ins/unsharp/dialog_f.c
	* plug-ins/unsharp/dialog_i.c
	* plug-ins/unsharp/unsharp.c: // IS NOT A VALID C COMMENT

1999-08-26  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	Overhaul of pixmap brushes and pipes: No separate pixmap pipe
	brush tool any longer. The paintbrush, airbrush and pencil
	tools, which already knew how to handle the single-pixmap
	brushes now also handle the pipes as well.

	* app/pixmapbrush.{h,c}
	* app/gimpbrushpixmap.{h,c}: Removed these files.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Remove from here, too.

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.{h,c}: Total overhaul.

	* app/gimpbrushpipeP.h: New file.

	* app/paint_core.h
	* app/apptypes.h: Some more types moved to apptypes.h

	* app/context_manager.c
	* app/tool_options.c
	* app/tools.c
	* app/toolsF.h: Remove PIXMAPBRUSH tool.

	* app/gimpbrush.h: New method: select_brush. Used to change the
	brush in paint_core, for pipe brushes.

	* app/gimpbrush.c: Add gimp_brush_select_brush, which is dummy for
	the normal brushes (returns the same brush).

	* app/paint_core.c: Call the brush's select_brush method to get a
	potential new brush before calling the paint_func.

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: Various changes related to the pixmap and
	pipe overhaul.

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/pencil.c: Reorder code a bit in the tool motion function to
	avoid executing unnecessary code in the case of a pixmap brush.

	Other changes in the same commit:

	* app/install.c: Make quote_spaces extern.

	* app/appenv.h: Declare it.

	* libgimp/gimpui.def: Add missing entry points.

	* libgimp/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add missing objects to gimpui.

1999-08-26  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/module_db.c: Put the list above the description instead of
	to the left in the module browser. Fits much better on the screen and
	looks better.

1999-08-26  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/info_window.c: i18n fix

Wed Aug 25 12:17:05 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: more i18n fixes (missed a patch from before)

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: added gpb

1999-08-24  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* tools/Makefile.am: Comment out gcg stuff.

Tue Aug 24 22:50:28 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/nav_window.c

	Preview now updated when image is modified. Done on a two second +
	idle timer. However the preview cache needs modifying since
	the tiles are transversed twice. Once for small previews then for
	larger ones. Should only be done once.
	
Tue Aug 24 12:49:35 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/menus.c
	* plug-ins/common/autostretch_hsv.c
	* plug-ins/common/compose.c
	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c
	* plug-ins/common/mail.c
	* plug-ins/print/print.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: big i18n fix patch
	from SHIRASAKI Yasuhiro <yasuhiro@awa.tohoku.ac.jp>. Fixes those
	pesky menu problems

Tue Aug 24 20:32:39 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/grid.c: use real-life units

	I have heavily commented the interface code in the hope that it will
	help other plug-in developers to adapt their plug-ins to make use
	of the gimp_size_entry functionality. 
	
	We need more units support in the plug-ins!!

Mon Aug 23 22:41:52 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/paint_funcs.c: fixed bug in scale_region that caused what
	looks like scan line swapping.

1999-08-24  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: Added saving of .gih files.

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Small changes, renamed the parasite.

	* docs/parasites.txt: Suggesta a parasite for pixmap brush pipes.

	* docs/gih.txt: Add the above parasite on the second line after
	the number of brushes. Suggest how to edit brush pipes.

	* docs/gpb.txt: Mention the gpb plug-in. 

	* app/pixmapbrush.c: Small clarification.

	Fixes by Hans Breuer:

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Add missing entries.

	* app/gimpimage.h: Added declaration of	gimp_image_{freeze,thaw}_undo.

	* modules/makefile.msc: Drop the .msvc from dll names.

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Guard inclusion of
	unistd.h. (save_dialog): Restrict text box height to help people
	with small displays.

1999-08-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/color_panel.[ch]: new function color_panel_set_color().

	* app/color_picker.c: added a color panel to the color picker info
	dialog and a toggle button to the color picker's tool options
	which allows color updates to be effective in the info dialog
	only.

	* app/info_dialog.[ch]: changed the packing parameters of the info
	table. Small fixes.

	* app/palette.c: the name created for dropped colors contained " "
	instead of "0".

1999-08-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/color_area.c
	* app/color_panel.c
	* app/color_select.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.[ch]
	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: pass the widget to the color dnd callbacks.

	* app/palette.c: color dnd for the palette dialog. Shift+click
	toggles setting the FG/BG color now.

1999-08-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/color_select.[ch]: color dnd for the standard color
	selection widget (the "GIMP" color notebook page).

Mon Aug 23 23:25:05 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c
	* app/nav_window.c
	
	Nav window code now handles boundary conditions correctly (ie
	you can scroll to the edges of the image now).
	It also has some key bindings:-
	
	1) Arrow keys work as expected
	2) =/- keys perform zoomin/zoomout. Note these keys are hardcoded
	at present until (if) I find away of finding out how to get the
	current accel. keys for these functions.
	3) Space will raise the display window to the top of the window stack.
	It also updates the preview. This will be changed to happen 	
	automatically RSN.

	Tearoff menus are now popped up and down (like other dialogs) when
	the tab key is pressed in the image window.

Mon Aug 23 19:55:48 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: fixed display of distance in the info window

Mon Aug 23 10:37:24 EDT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.5.in: add docs for %Dx image-title-format string.

Mon Aug 23 10:15:32 EDT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	Dirty flag now correct in all cases.  Can be displayed in image
	window title too.  See NOTE near gimp_image_dirty() for details.

	* app/fileops.c: gimp_image_clean_all() after reverting an image.
	* app/gdisplay.c: register handlers for gimage dirty and clean
	    signals to update image title.  New image-title-format
	    expansion: %Dx expands to x if the image is dirty.
	* app/gdisplay_ops.c: gimage->dirty flags != 0 is the correct
	    condition to test to see if an image is dirty.
	* app/gimpdrawable.c: gimp_image_dirty() should never be called
	    except from an undo_push_* function.  Call
	    undo_push_cantundo() if you want to dirty the image but can't
	    be bothered writing an undo handler (be ashamed of yourself!).
	* app/gimpimage.c: new gimage signal: clean.  Emitted when an undo
	    operation takes place.  Gimage changes when either dirty or
	    clean is emitted, so if you need to update previews etc, look
	    for both!  Move group_count into gimage structure, since
	    leaving it as a static in undo.c is bad if two undo groups are
	    started on different images at the same time.  More changes
	    of gimp_image_dirty() to undo_push_cantundo()
	    (parasite-related, plus layer moves).  See the NOTE on dirty
	    counter near gimp_image_dirty() for the full story.
	    gimp_image_dirty() and gimp_image_clean() simplified - counter
	    can go negative.
	* app/gimpimageP.h: group_count moved from undo.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: push undo for layer name change, rather
	    than dirtying the image.
	* app/undo.c: layer rename undo functions
	    added. undo_push_cantundo() convenience functions added.
	    group_count made per-gimage since everything else is.  When
	    blowing away redo stack, make image infinitely dirty if redo
	    info contained file save point.
	* app/undo.h: added undo_push_layer_rename() and
	    undo_push_cantundo().
	* TODO: added idea for undo history window.

1999-08-23  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/bucket_fill.[ch]: export bucket_fill_region().

	* app/channels_dialog.c: enabled dropping a color to a channel.

	* app/color_area.c
	* app/color_panel.c
	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: the whole color dnd is now done in a generic
	function in gimpdnd.c (dnd of other types is still hacked in at
	various places but will go to generic functions and callbacks as
	well).

	* app/disp_callbacks.[ch]
	* app/interface.c: drop a color to the display to bucket fill the
	selected region.

Mon Aug 23 02:19:12 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/paint_funcs.c: fixed a couple of bugs in the scale_region code.

Mon Aug 23 00:56:59 EDT 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>
	
	* app/gimpbrushhose.c
	* app/gimpbrushhose.h:
		removed.
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.h:
		New files to replace the above
	* app/gimpbrushlist.c
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/pixmapbrush.c
	* app/Makefile.am:
		s/hose/pipe. Seems someone else uses that name,
	so change it to pipe. 

	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gimpbrush.h
	* app/gimpbrushpixmap.c
	* app/patterns.c
	* app/patterns.h
	* app/pixmapbrush.c:
		Added functions to do the actual loading of 
	brush/pattern dialog. Use them where approriate instead
	of c&p the same code all over the place. 
	
	* app/pixmapbrush.c: Fix the bug where masks and brush
	data werent aligned. I didnt quite notice that 
	paint_core_get_paint_area returns an area with a 1 pixel
	border larger than the brush. Ooops.

	* TODO: just update a few things while I'm at it
	(pixmap/pipe stuff in particular)

Sun Aug 22 15:49:10 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: add check for zlib for building psp plugin

	* plug-ins/common/mkgen.pl
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: add psp plugin

	* plug-ins/common/mail.c: removed double gimp_destroy_params, fixing
	a segfault

1999-08-22  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Use g_message, not gimp_message.
	g_message calls gimp_message eventually. Disable the debugging
	messages.

	* plug-ins/common/gpb.c: New plug-in for saving Adrian's gpb files
	(pixmap brushes) from an RGBA image. Probably just of temporary
	value.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add it.

	* plug-ins/common/gbr.c: Use g_message instead of printf.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Comment out the gcg stuff here,
	too. Remove frac.o.
	
1999-08-22  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/color_area.[ch]
	* app/color_panel.[ch]
	* app/gimpdnd.[ch]: enabled dnd for colors (compatible with the
	standard gtk/gnome color dnd). The color selection is now invoked
	on a real click, not on button_down to avoid confusion with dnd.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: minor dnd updates/fixes.

	* app/channel.[ch]
	* app/channel_pvt.h
	* app/docindex.[ch]
	* app/docindexif.[ch]
	* app/drawable.[ch]
	* app/floating_sel.c
	* app/gimage.[ch]
	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* app/gimpdrawableP.h
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]
	* app/gimpimageP.h
	* app/layer.[ch]
	* app/layer_pvt.h
	* app/undo.c
	* app/xcf.c: wanted to do some s/int/gboolean/ in the layer files
	where appropriate and found myself spending the whole night doing
	a big code review for layers/channels/drawables/images:
	s/int/gboolean/, s/<type>/g<type>/, lots of indentation, removed
	some old global variables and deprecated functions, #include
	cleanups, proper prototypes, copyright headers, ...

1999-08-22  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/measure.c
	* app/pixmapbrush.c: i18n fixes

1999-08-22  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/tool_options.c: Remember kids, "Options" is spelled "Options",
	not "Ootions"

1999-08-22  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/convert.c: Use spinbutton for number of colours.

	* app/preferences_dialog.h: Export gimp_spin_button_new. Not the
	most logical place for it, though.

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: Handle the tube block, too. Save tube
	(image hose) parameters in a parasite. Yet-to-be-written code
	that creates a .gih file (or something better) can get them
	from there.

	Actually attach the comment parasite.

	Must set layer offset after adding it to the image.

Sat Aug 21 17:34:53 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: version number bump

	* autogen.sh
	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am: comment out gcg stuff, nobody seems to be using it

	* app/colormap_dialog.*: added generated files

Sat Aug 21 22:32:25 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/brush_scale.[ch]: implemented brush_scaling for pixmap brushes.
	This commit is done only to get some working code in before I start to
	move all the brush_preview crap into one central place.

Sat Aug 21 20:30:48 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/frac.[ch]: Eradicated.

	* app/xcf.c: In mourning.

1999-08-21  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/errorconsole.c: Also provide a Clear button.

	* app/gimprc.c: Add a missing static function declaration.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add new files.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Add new entry points.

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Must include glib.h first. You don't
	want to know why.

	* plug-ins/common/psp.c: New file. This plug-in Loads Paint Shop
	Pro files (.psp and .tub). Doesn't yet save them. Handles only 24-
	bit images (with or without alpha) correctly so far.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Build psp. Somebody please add
	it to the auto* build system, too. I guess a test for zlib (which it
	needs) is needed in configure.in.

Sat Aug 21 16:53:17 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c:  Preview layers need to be alpha-padded,
	since they're not on the bottom of the stack.  That's a GIMP rule.

	Plus... use new API functions gimp_image_{freeze,thaw}_undo() to avoid
	the dilemma of either consuming a squillion superfluous tiles or
	clobbering the whole undo stack.

	* app/gimage.h
	* app/gimage_cmds.c
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: New API functions
	gimp_image_{freeze,thaw}_undo()	to avoid the above twin	evils.
	Similar to gimp_image_{disable,enable}_undo() but without
	clobbering the undo stack (I would have simply changed the latter,
	but too many plugins seem to rely on that behaviour).  See the PDB
	docs for slightly more information.
	
Sat Aug 21 8:47:00 CST 1999  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c : added a patch by Xach for slider
        being inactive when checkbox isn't marked.

Sat Aug 21 15:16:00 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: corrected my last "fix"
	* app/paint_core.c: corrected an error in the modifier handling I 
	introduced earlier

Sat Aug 21 13:30:38 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: corrected the guides placement and added 
	the possibility to use an info window (e.g. for the case
	that the user chooses not to have a statusbar)

Sat Aug 21 01:18:08 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/gimprc.[ch]: removed cubic_interpolation variable.
	* app/transform_core.c: use the interpolation_type variable 
	instead of the old cubic_interpolation variable.

Sat Aug 21 21:03:00 CST 1999  Seth J. Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: committed patch by Steinar Gunderson
        <sgunderson@bigfoot.com> that has previews, subsampling, choice
        of dct, and the kitchen sink.  Very cool.

Sat Aug 21 01:06:53 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/nav_window.c: Navigation window shows checkmarked alpha,
	also previews correctly for greyscale images now.

Sat Aug 21 00:07:37 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/nav_window.c: Improved pointer tracking when
	dragging navigator rectangle - less lag.  Enabled hourglass
	when computing first thumbnail.

1999-08-20  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpdnd.c: new file. Contains a function which creates dnd
	preview icons for all kinds of drawables.

	* app/gimpdnd.h: added the new dnd types.

	* app/channels_dialog.c: same dnd functions as in the layers
	dialog. Fixed channels_dialog_flush(). Code cleanup.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: enabled dnd for layer masks.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c: dnd code generalization. The toolbox and the
	display accept drop of any kind of drawable now.

	* app/gimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: new function gimp_image_position_channel().

	* app/layer.[ch]: new function layer_mask_get_layer().

Fri Aug 20 02:17:18 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/apptypes.h: added InterpolationType enum.
	* app/gimprc.[ch], app/preferences_dialog.c: replaced 
	cubic_interpolation flag with interpolation_type variable.

	* app/pixel_region.[ch]: added pixel_region_has_alpha function.

	* app/paint_funcs.c: rewrote scale_region.  It now behaves
	correctly on images with alpha, no longer leaves an artifact on the
	right edge of images when scaling up, and runs significantly
	faster.

Fri Aug 20 11:21:57 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/tips_dialog.c (read_tips_file): open tips file with "rt".

1999-08-19  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpdnd.h: new file containing the dnd data definitions.

	* app/disp_callbacks.[ch]
	* app/interface.c: drop layers on the toolbox to create a new
	image and on the display to copy it to the image's layer stack.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: drop layer on the "New" button to create an
	empty layer with the dropped layer's properties, to "Duplicate" to
	duplicate it and on the trashcan to delete it.
	Thanks to Andy for the ultra-cool dnd preview pixmap patch.

	* app/layer.[ch]
	* app/undo.c: renamed layer_mask() to layer_get_mask(). Prototyped
	some function headers.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: Wheelmouse stuff: Shift+wheel scales the
	display.

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/eraser.c
	* app/paint_options.h
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/pencil.c
	* app/tool_options.c: moved the "Incremental" toggle to the
	PaintOptions structure because it is used more often now.

Thu Aug 19 18:27:42 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: use <Ctrl> and/or <Alt> to add horizontal
	and/or vertical guides at the handle position

Wed Aug 18 23:44:15 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: #include "channel.h" and "layer.h"
	for GIMP_CHANNEL, GIMP_IS_LAYER, and GIMP_LAYER #defines

Thu Aug 19 00:18:32 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>
	
	* data/brushes/vine.gih
	* data/brushes/pepper.gpb: new files, a sample hose
	and a sample pixmap brush

	* docs/gpb.txt
	* docs/gih.txt: vague description of the current pixmap
	brush and hose formats

	* app/gimpbrushhose.c
	* app/gimpbrushpicmap.c: use the brush spacing info now

Wed Aug 18 22:49:31 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>
	
	* app/apptypes.h: add GradientPaintMode enum
	* app/paint_core.h: move above enum
	* app/paintbrush.c: use above enum

	* app/drawable_cmds.c: include "layers.h" so it
	will link again

1999-08-19  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/*.[ch]: Actually use the enum types GimpImageType,
	GimpImageBaseType, LayerModeEffects, PaintApplicationMode,
	BrushApplicationMode, GimpFillType and ConvertPaletteType, instead
	of just int or gint. Hopefully I catched most of the places
	where these should be used.

	Add an enum ConvolutionType, suffix the too general constants
	NORMAL, ABSOLUTE and NEGATIVE with _CONVOL. Use NORMAL_MODE
	instead of NORMAL in some places (this was what was intended). Fix
	some minor gccisms.

	* app/apptypes.h: New file. This file contains the above
	enumeration types, and some opaque struct typedefs. It was
	necessary to collect these in one header that doesn't include
	other headers, because when we started using the above mentioned
	types in the headers, all hell broke loose because of the
	spaghetti-like cross-inclusion mess between headers.

	(An example: Header A includes header B, which includes header C
	which includes A. B uses a type defined in A. This is not defined,
	because A hasn't defined it yet at the point where it includes B,
	and A included from B of course is skipped as we already are
	reading A.)

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: Add apptypes.h.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: Add a few casts.

Wed Aug 18 20:49:48 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: Almost complete now. Pressing <Shift> in one of
	the handles adds a third one to measure arbitrary angles. Still
	need to add a possbility to add guides at the handle position.

1999-08-18  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/gimpbrushhose.c (gimp_brush_hose_load): Fix it. Now the hose
	itself, interpreted as a pixmap brush (which the hose is a
	subclass of), is the first brush in its list. The rest of the
	pixmap brushes in the list are separately allocated ones. Don't
	read the pattern names into dummy buffers, just seek past.

	* app/pixmapbrush.c (pixmapbrush_motion): Now works better, and
	actually steps through the pixmaps in the hose's list. The
	paint_core->brush (which points to a brush hose in the cases we're
	interested in) is temporarily replaced with the current pixmap
	brush to use, and restored after applying the pixmap brush.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add new files.

Tue Aug 17 16:36:54 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_uninstall_temp_proc): Prevent calling free with
	undefined memory pointer. This happened if the name wasn't found
	in the hash table. 

Mon Aug 16 20:48:33 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpbrushhose.c
	* app/gimpbrushhose.h: new files to implement a GimpBrushHose
	type. The idea being its derived from gimpbrushes, so we can
	make regular tools use it if need be, and fold it into the brushes
	dialog nice and easy.

	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c
	* app/gimpbrushpixmap.c:
	* app/gimpbrushpixmap.h: Modified the *_get_type() functions
	to behave more correctly. As suggested by Tim Janik <tim@gtk.org>

	* app/pixmapbrush.c: Since pixmapbrush tool wasnt doing anything
	useful anyway, start using it as a testbed for "image hoses".
	Right now it doesnt really work correctly. 

	* app/paintbrush.c: force pixmaps to use INCREMENTAL

1999-08-16  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/transform_core.c: Use RINT instead of rint.

	* plug-ins/common/curve_bend.c
	* plug-ins/sel2path/spline.c: Workarounds for gccisms, thanks to
	Hans Breuer.

	* app/makefile.msc
	* plug-ins/makefile.msc: Misc fixes.

Mon Aug 16 03:46:43 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/transform_core.c: put the gimp_matrix_is_simple 
	optimization back in.

Mon Aug 16 01:24:42 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/transform_core.c: data access optimizations from
	David Hodson <hodsond@acm.org>

1999-08-16  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/appenv.h: Add G_SQRT2.

	* app/iscissors.c: Use it.

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add new files.
	
	* */makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Use libintl extracted from glibc from a
	separate directory, not from gettext, because of licensing issues
	(we want to use the LGPL version in GTk+, so use it here, too).

Sun Aug 15 20:42:04 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/appenv.h: added a G_PI_2

	* app/brush_header.h
	* app/pattern_header.h: prefixed each FILE_VERSION with
	G{BRUSH,PATTERN} to avoid namespace collision

	* app/patterns.c: reflect above change

	* app/iscissors.[ch]: merged in Austin's iscissors rewrite.. still
	unfinished, but it's not like the old one did anything useful
	anyway ;)

Sun Aug 15 23:10:21 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.c: sqeezed out the last bugs out of the current
	implemenatation (at least I hope so). Please test this on 
	non-Linux platforms.

Sun Aug 15 22:14:20 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/measure.[ch]: new files
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/pixmaps2.h
	* app/tools.c
	* app/toolsF.h: added new Measure tool.
	The tool is not yet finished ...

Sat Aug 14 14:35:16 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c
	* app/paint_core.c: movements restricted to 45 degrees (Ctrl+Alt) 
	feel more natural now

Fri Aug 13 15:28:00 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: add pixmaps/dropper.xpm to EXTRA_DIST

	* app/appenv.h: minor formatting changes

	* app/channel.c: #include "gdisplay.h"

	* app/color_transfer.c
	* app/dodgeburn.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/iscissors.c
	* app/paint_core.c: remove extra SQR and ROUND definitions

	* app/flip_tool.c: hackaround the flip tool options constant problem

	* app/flip_tool.[ch]: use InternalOrientationType for flip_tool_flip
	prototype

	* app/interface.c: use GTK_LABEL case in gtk_label_set_justify

	* plug-ins/common/mkgen.pl
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: add @extra EXTRA_DIST processing

Fri Aug 13 16:39:25 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/pencil.c
	* app/pixmapbrush.c
	* app/pixmapbrush.h

	Added support for pixmap brushes to airbrush, pencil, 
	and paintbrush. Merging this into paintbrush makes
	the pixmaptool itself kind of useless at the moment,
	but that will change ;->

	Still a few rough edges here, but its mostly there. 
	I still need to make the "incremental" button for
	the tools to accurately reflect that pixmap always
	uses this mode. 

	* app/eraser.c
	* app/eraser.h
	* app/tools_cmds.c
	* app/paint_func.[ch]
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb

	Applied patch from  Shuji Narazaki <narazaki@gimp.org>
	to implement the anti-eraser. Neat.


1999-08-13  Kelly Martin  <kelly@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/brush_select.c: Color brushes now appear in the brush
	selector in color.  Scaling is disabled for color brushes because
	I can't figure out how to do it just now.  Still need to fix the
	toolbox to do this too.

Thu Aug 12 19:16:58 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>

	* app/pixmapbrush.c: added a fix from Xach "I dont code."
	Beane <xach@gimp.org> to fix the behaviour when painting
	at the top of images.

Thu Aug 12 23:15:53 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/commands.h
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/info_dialog.c
	* app/info_dialog.h
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/info_window.h
	* app/menus.c
	* app/scale.c
	* app/scroll.c
	* app/scroll.h
	* app/nav_window.c (new)
	* app/nav_window.h (new)
	* pixmap/dropper.xpm (new)

	New "navigator" image (accessed via <Image>/Window Nav..). This gives
	an outline of the location of the current view on an image. Eg if your
	image window is only showing part of an image then the Window Navigation
        window will outline the area viewed. You can "drag" the outlined 
	square around the viewport and the main image will scroll. Additional
	a single click outside the square will center the image at that 
	location.

	Also started to add additional information to a new page inside the
	Window information dialog (currently only pixel value is shown).

	Both these features are currently work in progress and unfinished. 
	In particular the Navigator does not keep in step with changes
	to the basic image (however it does keep in step with image size changes
        and if you modify the size of the image viewing window). It also
	does not display the transparent areas of images very nicely. 
	 
1999-08-13  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc} (gimp_OBJECTS): Add newest files.

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c: Speed up by using
	gimp_tile_cache_size().

	* app/gimprc.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Guard
	use of GLIB_CHECK_VERSION from old GLibs that don't have it.

Thu Aug 12 19:53:19 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/brush_scale.[ch]: new files that add brush-scaling
	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/indicator_area.c: Scale brushes in the preview so they fit
	into the preview area. We will use this code for pressure-sensitive
	brush-scaling too, but I have to create a GUI for that first.

Thu Aug 12 18:54:38 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimprc.pdb: made the monitor resolution 
	accessible through a PDB function

	* app/internal_procs.c
	* app/gimprc_cmds.c: changed the autogenerated files

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c: set the image resolution to the
	monitor resolution and unset the image name

Tue Aug 10 01:15:59 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>
	
	* app/pixmapbrush.c: fixed the weirdness with drawing
	along the left side of the image. Top's still weird

Mon Aug  9 22:46:34 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>
	
	* app/pixmapbrush.c: couple of warning clean ups and
	some minor fleshing out, fix a bit of the border problems

Mon Aug  9 01:20:24 1999 Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>

	* app/pixmapbrush.c 
	* app/pixmapbrush.h
	* app/gimpbrushpixmap.c
	* app/gimpbrushpixmap.h: New files, implement the GimpBrushPixmap
	  object, and the pixmap brush tool.

	* app/context_manager.c
	* app/tool_options.c 
	* app/tools.c
	* app/toolsF.h: add the pixmap brush tool in

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: allow for loading of pixmap brushes and
	displaying them in the brush dialog. Currently it only shows the
	grey scale mask.

	*app/Makefile.am: add the pixmap tool stuff to the build process

	These Changes implement a pixmap brush tool. Sort of a "image stamp".
	Some examples can be seen at http://adrian.gimp.org/pixmap-brush/.

	Some examples of pixmap brushes can be found there too (.gpb
	extension), but these are easy enough to make (for now, make
	a pattern and a brush the same size and `cat foo.gbr foo.pat >
	foo.gpb` ;->

	Theres still a few rough edges that need some tweaking, but
	the framework is there. Figured I'd sneak it in before the
	freeze.

1999-08-08  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c: New Windows-only plug-in, an
	interface to the Windows clipboard. (Now we can cut and paste
	images between the GIMP and other applications!). Thanks to Hans
	Breuer for the implementation.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.

Sat Aug  7 15:30 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org> 
	* channel.c
	* channel.h : more public accessors; eventually things should be 
	              rewritten to use them so we aren't #include'ing 
                      channel_pvt.h all over (uck)
	* channel_ops.c
	* gimpimage.c
	* gimpimageP.h
	* interface.c
	* paint_core.c
	* paths_dialog.c
	* qmask.c
	* qmask.h : Added a dialog to let you choose your qmask properties
                    when you double click either button.

Fri Aug  6 13:07:58 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* libgimp/gimpenv.c (gimp_directory): set gimp_directory
	to GIMPDIR if it isn't defined (for OS/2 only).

	* app/datafiles.c (datafiles_read_directories): Handle drives in 
	directory paths. For OS/2.

1999-08-05  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/appenv.h: Define ROUND(), RINT(), SQR(), G_PI and
	G_PI_4. The latter two will presumably eventually be in
	GLib. RINT() calls rint() if we have it, otherwise adds 0.5 and
	calls floor().

	* app/*.c: Remove the multiple identical definitions of M_PI. Use
	G_PI instead of M_PI. Remove ROUND() and rint() definitions. Use
	RINT() instead of rint().

Tue Aug  3 22:16:57 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: My last change to the dnd code did fix the bug
	but disabled loading multiple files. Now applied a new patch from
	Shuji Narazaki <narazaki@gimp.org>.

Fri Jul  2 18:05:44 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose_storage.c (parse_genuine_float):
	Fix bug with negative values.

Tue Aug  3 18:13:47 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * app/interface.c: Display multi-line messages left-justified
        instead of centered.

Tue Aug  3 02:13:57 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/transform_core.c: Improvements to the transform_core_do and 
	cubic routines by David Hodson <hodsond@acm.org>
	"This fixes a number of annoying inaccuracies in transform_core.
	The identity transform now leaves all pixels unchanged; previously
	it shifted the image by 1/2 pixel left and up. All edges of an
	image are now correctly antialiased after a transform. The cubic
	interpolation function has been changed to a slightly smoother one.
	The code has been tidied and rearranged for some minor improvements
	in efficiency, but the basic logic and tile handling have not changed."

1999-08-03  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: Distribute the Windows-only
	plug-ins, too.

	* plug-ins/print/print.c: Use gimp_personal_rc_file().

	* plug-ins/common/winprint.c: Move here from separate directory.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Update correspondingly.

	* app/gimprc.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Guard against
	different g_strescape API in GLib 1.2 and 1.3.1.

	* app/gimprc.c: Check for g_get_home_dir() returning NULL.

Mon Aug  2 19:19:19 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

         * tools/pdbgen/pdb/procedural_db.pdb,
         plug-ins/common/tiff.c: _Very_ minor documentation fixes.

Mon Aug  2 21:15:08 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: Eeek, how has the dnd stuff ever worked before?
	Shame on me, I should have looked into the patch before applying it
	instead of only testing if it works. Hopefully we do the right thing
	now.

Sun Aug  1 19:27:49 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.8 release

	* configure.in: version number bump

Mon Aug  2 03:42:03 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        "Cancel "instead of "Yes" and "No".

1999-08-02  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/winprint: New (Win32) print plug-in.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Built winprint, not the Unixish
	print plug-in.

Sun Aug  1 16:27:27 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_core.c: Fixed a bug in the line-preview. 

1999-08-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/channel_ops.c (offset_halfheight_callback): Fix
	cut-and-paste error reported by Claes G Lindblad.

Thu Jul 29 22:06:41 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: revert previous change

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/guides.pdb: perform orientation xform here

	* app/gimpimage.h: use 2 enums, one for internal and for external

	* libgimp/gimpenums.h: change around external enums here

Fri Jul 30 02:34:43 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * app/gimpparasite.c: I escaped everything when writing out
        parasites with \, everything except the \ itself. Argh.

Fri Jul 30 02:01:16 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * docs/parasites.txt: add some suggested colour parasites (no icc
        profile).

Thu Jul 29 17:18:42 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: hard code orientation constants for
	shear and flip too maintain backwards compatibility

	* app/gimpimage.h: remove ORIENTATION chop to avoid namespace
	collision

Thu Jul 29 23:58:08 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add gdiplay_color. Create gimp.def
 	from gimp.sym.

	* app/gimp.def: Removed.

	* libgimp/gimpenv.c (gimp_data_directory) (Win32): Also check for
	the executable being in the plug-ins subdirectory.

 	brushes, papers and presets.

Thu Jul 29 03:20:36 1999  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_funcs.c, app/transform_core.c:  replace the cubic 
	functions with a better/faster version supplied by
	David Hodson <hodsond@acm.org>

	* app/brush_select.c: double clicking on a brush preview now opens up
	the brush editor.  Update the text displayed when the active brush
	changes size.

	* app/paint_funcs.c: slight modification to overlay_pixels.

Thu Jul 29 02:42:17 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/channel.pdb: Remove a call to
 	channel_set_opacity() at a point where channel always is NULL,
 	causing a crash. The next statement calls channel_new() (passing
 	the opacity), and assigns its return value to channel, so there
 	shouldn't be any need to call channel_set_opacity()?

	* app/channel_cmds.c: Corresponding change in generated file.

	* plug-ins/winsnap: New Win32-only plug-in: whole display or
 	single window screenshot. Thanks to Craig Setera.

	* plug-ins/makefile.{cygwin,msc}: Add the curve_bend,
 	sample_colorize and winsnap plug-ins.

Wed Jul 28 16:17:29 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimp.sym
	* app/gdisplay_color.[ch]
	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gdisplay.h

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimage.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/guides.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: reflect above enum changes, whitespace
	cleanups

	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl

Wed Jul 28 21:32:52 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* libgimp/gimpenv.c (gimp_data_directory): Add __XOS2RedirRoot() for

	by Wolfgang Hofer <hof@hotbot.com>

1999-07-28  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gdisplay_ops.c: tweaked one more dialog box: "Changes were
	made to %s. Close anyway?"

	* app/layers_dialog.c: Eek, layers_dialog_flush() was assuming
	that layers can be moved by one position only and thus traversed
	and reordered the same list at the same time. Should work with
	arbitrarily misplaced layers now.
	Fixed some strange dnd special cases and cleaned up the dnd code.

Wed Jul 28 03:42:34 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/pixel_regionP.h: new file that shold have gone with my last
	commit.

	* app/clone.c: more cursor support.
	* app/cursorutil.[ch], cursors/{bad,badmsk}: new cursor
	* app/paint_core.c: fix that rounding error the right way this time.
	* app/pixel_processor.c, app/pixel_region.c:  Lock the tiles while 
	they are being processed.  Only create new threads if the region
	being processed is large enough to warrant it.

1999-07-27  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/zoom_in.xpm
	* pixmaps/zoom_out.xpm: I think the zoom buttons needed
	handles to make them easier to grab. %-)

1999-07-27  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* configure.in: Added 'cs' to ALL_LINGUAS

1999-07-27  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	to desaturate and equalize.

	* app/gimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]: new function gimp_image_position_layer().

	* app/layers_dialog.c: drag'n'drop movement of layers.

1999-07-27  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/transform_tool.c: Fixed a typo

1999-07-27  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	are pressed. 

1999-07-26  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/topath.xpm 
	* pixmaps/toselection.xpm 
	* pixmaps/anchor.xpm: some icons

Sun Jul 25 23:37:48 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* paint_core.c: fixed long standing roundoff error in
	paint_core_subsample_mask.  A couple of minor code cleanups.

1999-07-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/errorconsole.[ch]: forgot to checkin this one...

	Wheelmouse support and a hack to set the message_handler to 
	ERROR_CONSOLE and back to MESSAGE_BOX box when showing/hiding the
	dialog (should interact with preferences).

1999-07-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/gradient.c: wheelmouse support for the brush/pattern lists
	and for the gradient preview.

1999-07-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/color_picker.[ch]: set the "preserve" flag to FALSE. This
	way the tool doesn't have to detect drawable changes by itself.
	Misc stuff like below.

	* app/gradient.c: heavily changed the beast:

	- Reviewed the whole ui code and indented it.
	- Standard ui for all sub-dialogs.
	- Handle the wm delete event of the sub-dialogs.
	- "+" and "-" pixmaps instead of "zoom in" and "zoom out".
	- Made the gradient preview resizable again.
	- i18n fixes.
	- Removed some code duplication in the sub-dialogs' cancel/delete
	  callbacks.
	- Grouped functions together and commented the groups and their
	  prototypes.
	- Didn't change any core functionality (just the ui).
	- Please don't kill me, but I couldn't resist to indent most
	  functions ;-)

	* app/info_dialog.c: no need to call gettext() on a string which
	was passed to a function (it's the job of the caller).

	* app/ink.c: grab the pointer in the blob preview.

	* app/palette.c: standardized the ui of the dialog and all it's
	sub-dialogs, function header indentation, namespace cleanup.

Fri Jul 23 00:01:05 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* ./app/clone.c
	* ./app/airbrush.c
	* ./app/bezier_select.c
	* ./app/paintbrush.c
	* ./app/eraser.c
	* ./app/convolve.c
	* ./app/smudge.c
	* ./app/dodgeburn.c
	* ./app/pencil.c
	* ./app/paint_core.c

	Better stroking of paths. 
	First point in stroke path is now correctly painted (try stroking
	with a brush spacing of > 100.0 in gimp 1.0.x). 
	Fixed problem in paint_core_interpolate() where points were 
	missed in some cases.
	(BTW for those who do not know the brush spacing means as follows:-
	A spacing of 100.0 means brush strokes are placed next to each other
	exactly with no gaps or overlaps. A spacing of 200.0 means only
	alternate spaces are filled with the brush paint. A setting of 50.0
	means the brush paints positions overlap by 50% of the brush width.
	So 100.0 corresponds to exactly the brush width! It took me 
	ages to figure this simple thing out!) 
	 
1999-07-22  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brightness_contrast.c: same cleanups as in my previous
	checkin.

	* app/gradient.c: made the gradient editor look like the other
	dialogs. It's now possible to set the background color with
	<Ctrl>+click. Indentation madness in all functions I modified.

Thu Jul 22 21:24:04 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* plug-ins/common/film.c: Upgraded to gimp-1.1 calling conventions.

1999-07-22  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/channel_ops.[ch]: new ui for the "Layer Offset" dialog.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: major code cleanup: Folded some callbacks
	into common ones, "widget" instead of "w", indentation, ...

	* app/commands.c
	* app/interface.[ch]
	* app/global_edit.c: the query boxes must be shown by the caller
	now. There's no need to split up the string for the message box
	manually as the Gtk 1.2 label widget handles newlines corectly.
	Added the "edge_lock" toggle to the "Shrink Selection" dialog.
	Nicer spacings for the query and message boxes.

	* app/ink.c: tried to grab the pointer in the blob preview but
	failed. Left the code there as a reminder (commented out).

	* app/menus.c: reordered <Image>/Select.

	I was bored and grep-ed the sources for ancient or deprecated stuff:

	* app/about_dialog.[ch]
	* app/actionarea.[ch]
	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/brush_edit.c
	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/color_select.c
	* app/convert.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay_ops.c

	* app/palette.c
	* app/palette_select.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/resize.c
	* app/scale_toolc.c
	* app/text_tool.c:
	s/container_border_width/container_set_border_width/g,
	s/sprintf/g_snprintf/g, replaced some constant string lengths with
	strlen(x).

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/boundary.c
	* app/errors.[ch]
	* app/free_select.c
	* app/gimpbrushlist.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/iscissors.c
	* app/main.c
	* app/patterns.[ch]
	* app/text_tool.c: namespace fanaticism: prefixed all gimp error
	functions with "gimp_" and formated the messages more uniformly.

	* app/gradient.c
	* app/gradient_select.c: same stuff as above for the ui
	code. There are still some sub-dialogs which need cleanup.

	Did some cleanup in most of these files: prototypes, removed tons
	of #include's, i18n fixes, s/w/widget/ as above, indentation, ...

1999-07-22  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* plug-ins/common/gifload.c:
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: Fixed some tyops

1999-07-21  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* README.win32: Update gcc instructions. Remove warning about
 	gettext being GPL, as the GIMP is GPL, too, of course, and it
 	thus doesn't matter.

	* user_install.bat: Rename the template user gtkrc to gtkrc_user,
 	to reduce user confusion.

	* app/main.c: Small change for gcc on Win32 compilation.

	* */makefile.cygwin
	* app/module_db.c: With newest gcc-2.95 -fnative-struct on Win32,
 	no need to have differently named DLLs (including modules) for
 	(built by) gcc and MSVC.

	* app/module_db.c: Use g_strdup_printf() instead of
 	strlen(), g_malloc() and g_snprintf()

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: No need to distribute gimpfeatures.h.win32,
 	the suitable gimpfeatures.h is built when making the dist.

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.win32: Removed.

	* libgimp/makefile.cygwin
	* libgimp/makefile.msc: Remove gimpfeatures.h.win32.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: Win32 startup code changed a bit.

	* plug-ins/makefile.cygwin
	* plug-ins/makefile.msc: Add the winsnap unofficial plug-in.

	* plug-ins/common/animationplay.c
	* plug-ins/common/gz.c: (Win32) Hack aroung WinMain getting
	clashing declarations because these guys include gdkx.h (which
	includes windows.h), and gimp.h also declares WinMain on its own.

Wed Jul 21 00:00:35 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sel2path/fit.c
	* plug-ins/sel2path/pxl-outline.c

	Corrected more non-portable code problems.

1999-07-20  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

        * app/ink.c (ink_options_new): Changed the default step-width of
        the "size"-slider to 2 instead of 5.

Mon Jul 19 20:57:10 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: added dodgeburn.h for enum parsing

	1) Fixed the brushpreview popup problem where it remained onscreen
           if the mouse button was released in another GTK window that accepted
	   mouse events.

	2) Selection to path now works on all types of images (it should have
	   anyway).

	3) Fixed PDB so you can once again use the PDB interfaces to the clone
	   and airbrush tools.

	4) PDB Function to add a path to an image now adds it correctly.

	5) airbrush/paintbrush/clone/eraser/convolve New PDB functions that 
           use the options dialogs settings (or sane defaults if option dialog
           not present)

	6) Added PDB functions for Smudge & DodgeBurn tools.

	7) Path stroke command (from the LCP dialog) can now use any of the
	   painting tools (airbrush/paintbrush/clone/eraser/convolve/smudge/
           dodgeburn except ink). Just have the tool selected when you 
	   press the stroke button.

	this weekend and just couldn't resist...)

1999-07-19  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gdisplay.c (gdisplay_set_menu_sensitivity): moved the _()
	wrappers out of the macro again, so they actually get
	processed. Reported by <Daniel.Egger@t-online.de>.

Sat Jul 17 13:31:40 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.7 release

	* configure.in: version number bump

	* ltconfig

	* app/channel_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/channel.pdb: remove opacity_arg alias for channel
	  new

	name change.

	* app/context_manager.c: Include paint_options.h for prototype.

	* app/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_initialize_projection): Break out of
 	loop as soon as possible.

	* app/menus.c (menus_last_opened_cmd_callback): Check if referring
 	to entry not in list.

	* app/module_db.c (valid_module_name): (Win32) Require module DLL
 	names to include name of compiler built with.

	* app/paths_dialog.c (paths_draw_segment_points): No use to draw
 	lines if we have less that two points.

	* app/qmask.c: Include stdio.h and floating_sel.h.

	* libgimp/makefile.cygwin: New file.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am:  Distribute above file.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Update.

	* libgimp/gimpenv.c (gimp_directory): Don't warn about missing
 	home directory on Win32, it is perfectly natural.

	* plug-ins/sel2path/global.h: Bypass unused declarations, some
	of which clash with functions in MSVCRT.

	* plug-ins/sel2path/math.c
	* modules/colorsel_water.c: Define M_PI if necessary.

	* plug-ins/sel2path/sel2path.c: Include config.h and
 	glib.h. Define rint() if needed.
	
	* plug-ins/sel2path/vector.c: Include glib.h (for hypot() renaming
 	on Win32; In the MS C runtime, as hypot() is non-ANSI, it's called
 	_hypot(), sigh).

	* plug-ins/sinus/sinus_logo.h: Use indexed format, it is easier on
 	some compilers than the huge string.

Wed Jul 14 11:42:49 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c: we were leaking a blob at each button_press

Tue Jul 13 22:48:37 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sel2path/sel2path.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/paths_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb

	Selection is now cleared when converted to a path.
	Path is made the current one when created via the PDB.
	This made more sense than the previous behavior.

Tue Jul 13 15:47:20 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* gimptool.in, gimptool.1: implement --uninstall* options.

Sun Jul 11 20:50:26 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/unsharp/*: updated to version 0.8 
	(merged Marc's change)

Sun Jul 11 17:35:01 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* plug-ins/unsharp/unsharp.c: rename round to round2int to avoid
        clashes with the upcoming c9x standard.

Sun Jul 11 15:19:34 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* plug-ins/common/png.c: add abort() to save_image, as to catch
        bugs early on.
        
Sun Jul 11 14:05:06 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paths_dialog.c: my last change did break path deletion - this
	should be fixed now

Sat Jul 10 16:05:58 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/sel2path/math.c: 
	* plug-ins/sel2path/fit.c: Add <float.h> for FLT_MAX,FLT_MIN.

1999-07-10  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gdisplay.c (gdisplay_set_menu_sensitivity): Undo/Redo should
	be sensitive even if there is no layer :-)

	* app/commands.h
	* app/docindex.[ch]
	* app/docindexif.[ch]
	* app/file_new_dialog.[ch]: some #include cleanups.

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/Makefile.classic: less primitive version.

Fri Jul  9 23:35 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* app/qmask.c : fixed some small lil' bugs, made no selection not
	automatically select all.  More features later.

1999-07-10  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_canvas_events): added wheelmouse
	scrolling support for the canvas (cut & paste from gtkmain.c).
	CTRL+wheel scrolls horizontally.

Fri Jul  9 22:24:53 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/sel2path/* <- New directory
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* pixmap/topath.xpm

	New function implemented by a plugin.
	Will convert a selection into a path. Please
	see the README in sel2path directory for more
	details (especially where the underlying algorithms/code
	were obtained from).

Fri Jul  9 20:12:12 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: applied a (modified) patch from  
	Shuji Narazaki <narazaki@gimp.org> 

	* app/gimpimage.c: applied a (modified) patch from 
	Tom Rathborne <tomr@aceldama.com> that aligns guides on layer_resize

Fri Jul  9 18:39:03 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/clone.c
	* app/dodgeburn.c
	* app/pencil.c
	* app/smudge.c: applied a patch from Olof S Kylander
	<olof@frozenriver.com> that enables pressure sensitivity for all
	the tools that were missing it

Fri Jul  9 16:47:04 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpmatrix.[ch]: added a few functions to test for
	matrix properties

	* app/transform_core.c: if we are doing a simple transformation
	(e.g. rotating by 90 degrees), turn off interpolation

	* app/rotate_tool.c: persuade the slider that a rotate angle of
	180 degrees is perfectly ok

1999-07-09  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/crop.c: mysteriously, using the new tool constructor fixed
	the crop tool redraw problem.

	* app/gdisplay.c: code cleanup.

	* app/info_dialog.c: never emit signals when updating the info
	fields. Fixes some more transform tool grid redraw bugs.

1999-07-09  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/commands.c (view_toggle_rulers_cmd_callback): set the
	"visible" flags before mapping the widgets.

1999-07-08  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl (generate): Fix typo.
	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: Clean up srcdir != builddir.

Thu Jul  8 00:08:50 EDT 1999  Adrian Likins <alikins@redhat.com>

	* app/interface.c: added type for _NETSCAPE_URL to the DnD stuff
	so you can now drag image urls from netscape.

Wed Jul  7 20:33:24 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* pixmaps/locked.xpm: removed
	* pixmaps/locked.xbm: new file
	* app/paths_dialog.c: Use a bitmap in the style of the eye instead of
	the lock pixmap. This could be done more elegantly, but the 
	paths_dialog is a mess, sorry.

1999-07-07  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

        * app/gdisplay.c (gdisplay_set_menu_sensitivity): don't make menus
        unreachable by forgetting to set them sensitive again.

Wed Jul  7 12:53:54 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/global_edit.c: cosmetic changes

Tue Jul  6 22:05 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/qmask.h : took out a relic pixmaps.h that broke compilation (oops)

Tue Jul	 6 20:55 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/qmasknosel.xpm 
	* pixmaps/qmasksel.xpm: Ugly pixmaps that tigert promised to replace
	
 	* app/channel.[ch]
	* app/channel_cmds.c : made some of the private structures accessible
	  through exported functions to keep things a bit clean
	
	* app/interface.c
	* app/gdisplay.[ch]
	* app/gimpimageP.h
	* app/gimpimage.[ch]
	* app/undo.[ch]: added qmasks
	
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/qmask.[ch]: added new files for qmask support

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb: changed some channel stuff to keep things a bit
          more private

Wed Jul  7 03:54:54 MEST 1999  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c: Fixed typo. 
	We definitely need a pdbgen tool to generate the 
	script-fu enum wrappers....

Wed Jul  7 02:24:22 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: save RGBA data as string and not seuqences
	of numbers and commas. this reduces the output file size significantly
	(by 50-70%) and reduces compile time memory requirement majorly (down
	to 20% for gcc).

Tue Jul  6 22:26:24 CEST 1999  Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimpparasite.c: fixed gimp_detach_parasite.

Tue Jul  6 22:16:07 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* ./app/layer.c.orig
	* ./app/lc_dialog.c.orig
	* ./app/paths_dialog.c.orig
	* ./app/pathsP.h.orig
	* ./libgimp/gimpmenu.c.orig
	* ./tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb.orig
	* ./app/paths_cmds.c
	* ./app/internal_procs.c

	Fixed small LCP menu preview problems. Now works for all
	image types and updated correctly when alpha channel added.

	Additional PDB functions for paths. Fixed some PDB functions
	(gimp_paths_set_points). Now works as advertised.

Tue Jul  6 22:40:16 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/global_edit.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: Added "Paste As New" feature that allows to paste
	the current (or a named) buffer to a new image. Still need to
	add PDB calls for that...

Tue Jul  6 19:58:48 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/fuzzy_select.c: give user feedback on the threshold 
	* app/paintbrush.c: use an optionmenu for the gradient type
	instead of using 4 radiobuttons
	* app/blend.c: indentation paranoia

	Hopefully I have merged in Michaels changes correctly ...

Tue Jul  6 18:50:24 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: new save-image plugin to dump a
	straight c-source RGB or RGBA data array (most convenient
	to create libart ArtPixBuf structures from).

	* plug-ins/common/header.c (save_image): if we don't know the
	image type, complain and don't claim to have handled it.

1999-07-06  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

        * app/airbrush.c
        * app/blend.c
        * app/bucket_fill.c
        * app/clone.c
        * app/convolve.c

        * app/ink.c
        * app/paintbrush.c
        * app/pencil.c
        * app/smudge.c: get opacity/paint mode from the current context
        (currently always the user context).

        * app/gimage_mask.c: the "stroke" command uses the paintbrush's
        settings if the current context is the user context and we are in
        per-tool paint options mode.

        * app/context_manager.[ch]
        * app/paint_options.h
        * app/preferences_dialog.c
        * app/tool_options.c
        * app/tools.c: moved the global/per-tool paint options switching
        to the context manager. The tool options themselves only contain
        the widgets for them now. This should fix the segfaults happening
        in per-tool mode.
	Removed the disclaimer from the prefs. dlg. as it seems to work
	now. The impl. in the context manager however is still a hack.

        * app/brush_select.c
        * app/brushes_cmds.c
        * tools/pdbgen/pdb/brushes.pdb: same as above.

        * app/lc_dialog.c: minimal code reduction. No functionality changed.

Mon Jul  5 22:51:37 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* TODO: Removed zoom indicator in titlebar, since we already have
	    that.  Added more on progress indications, and dodge/burn. New
	    entries for active brushes and named undos.

Mon Jul  5 20:39:42 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/levels.c: change from greyscale bars to colour ones similar
	    to curves.c.  Is this any use to people?  If not, we can
	    always revert it.

1999-07-05  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: This is the Eeek!-one again, due to public
	demand :)

1999-07-04  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/color_notebook.c
	* libgimp/color_selector.h: Bypass the declaration of the exported
 	functions in the header. (Caused different linkage error with MSC,
 	as they are declared dllexport in the source, but naturally not in
 	the header.)

Sat Jul  3 16:04:16 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_notebook.c
	* plug-ins/common/borderaverage.c: fix include file paths

1999-07-03  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	It is now possible to build a fully functioning GIMP on Win32 with
 	free tools only. (gcc and friends running on cygwin, but producing
	binaries that don't use the cygwin runtime, gcc -mno-cygwin.)

	* README.win32: Advice about gcc.

	* libgimp/gimp.{c,h,def}: New way to get address of PLUG_IN_INFO
 	to the gimp dll. Do it a bit like the EMX port. Much cleaner. Now
 	works well also when built with gcc.

	* app/gimprc.c: Remove gratuituous printf.

	* modules/makefile.msc
	* plug-ins/makefile.msc
	* app/makefile.msc: Small updates.

	* modules/makefile.cygwin
	* plug-ins/makefile.cygwin
	* app/makefile.cygwin: New files.

	* modules/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* app/Makefile.am: Distribute the makefile.cygwin files.

	* app/color_notebook.c: Mark the two functions used by color
	selection modules for export.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Include <glib.h> early.

1999-07-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/dodgeburn.c: changed the tool toggle key to <Ctrl>.
	* app/tools.c: typo.

1999-07-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/[all tools]: the Tool structure is now allocated by a common
	constructor which sets default values and provides default tool
	action functions. To get rid of much code duplication there should
	be a object hierarchy of tools.

	* app/context_manager.c
	* app/tools.[ch]: create and destroy private contexts for the
	paint tools on startup and exit. They are not used yet.

	* app/interface.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/tools.h: num_tools is now exported in tools.h

	* app/commands.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/menus.c: made "Toggle Selection" a toggleable menu item.

Thu Jul  1 23:37:38 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* ifscompose_storage.c: New file implementing saving
	and loading of parameters in text format.

	* ifscompose.c: Store parameters in parasites.
	Also, use new format for storing parameters between
	invokations of IfsCompose on different layers.

Thu Jul  1 09:42:40 PDT 1999 Calvin Williamson  <calvin@rhythm.com>

	Added the files:

	*app/smudge.[ch]
	*app/dodgeburn.[ch]
	
	Changed:
	
	*app/Makefile.am
	*app/paint_core.c
	*app/paint_funcs.c
	*app/pixmaps2.h
	*app/tool_options.c
	*app/tools.c
	*app/toolsF.h
	
	This is the first version of the dodge and burn and smudge tools.
	These both use the opacity and spacing from the brush dialog, but
	they dont use the apply modes, since they both use a form of
	paint_core_replace. This could be added though.
	
	Smudge affects alpha channels when present, dodgeburn doesnt.

	Dodgeburn computes a gimp_lut based on the settings and uses that.

	Smudge just drags along a version of the initial painthit and mixes
	that in with subsequent painthits.
	
	I didnt added any pdb functionality yet.

Thu Jul  1 10:29:44 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/guides.pdb
	* app/guides_cmds.c: fixed a bug in image_find_next_guide

	* plug-ins/xjt: reflect the name change of gimp_image_find_next_guide

	* app/interface.c: applied the patch from 
	Shuji Narazaki <narazaki@gimp.org> that allows to open images by 
	dropping them onto the toolbar
	
1999-06-30  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: Dont even ask what this is :)

1999-06-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
	
	* app/crop.c (crop_automatic_callback): Crop now does
	AutoShrink -- the algorithm starts with the interactively
	selected crop area and tries to shrink that instead of 
	always starting from the corners.

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/helpbrowser.c: cosmetic changes
	
1999-06-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* */makefile.msc: Use the DEBUG nmake variable to determine
	whether to build for debugging or not.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Add some missing entry points.

	* plug-ins/makefile.msc: Redo as to Yosh's reorg of the
 	sources. Add some plug-ins missing earlier. (For instance print,
 	which only prints to files on Win32. We still need a real Win32
 	print plug-in. Much code probably could be lifted from the bmp
 	plug-in.)

	* plug-ins/MapObject/arcball.c: Change Qt_ToMatrix() to void,
 	instead of returning the address of its parameter (dubious
 	practise), as its value is never used anyway.

	For the following changes, thanks to Hans Breuer:

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.h: Check for feof, not to get
	into an endless loop on malformed files.

	* plug-ins/common/header.c: Support indexed images.

	* plug-ins/common/sunras.c
	* plug-ins/common/xwd.c
	* plug-ins/print/print.h
	* plug-ins/sgi/sgi.h: Include config.h, guard inclusion of
 	unistd.h. 

	* plug-ins/print/print.c: Guard for SIGBUS being undefined. Open
 	output file in binary mode.

1999-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
	    Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* help/Makefile.am
	* help/eek.png
	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/helpbroswer.c: to see what this change
	does, you'll have to compile it :)

1999-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
	    Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/plug_in.c: return a PDB_EXECUTION_ERROR if a procedure
	requested by a plugin doesn't exist.

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/*: The GIMP Help Browser!
	Not yet built by default. You need GtkXmHTML to make it work.
	There is a Makefile.classic for testing it.

	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in
	* help/*: some sample help files. Subdirs are possible, too.

1999-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/plug_in.c (plug_in_callback): removed the check for
	gdisplay_active() returning NULL because it caused all extensions
	to be un-callable when no image was open.

Sun Jun 27 19:34:22 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/session.c (save_sessionrc): fp = fopen (filename, "wt");
	Open file sessionrc always in TEXT mode (for OS/2 and Winxx).

1999-06-26  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/[all tool related files]
	* app/commands.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/interface.c: hopefully fixed the bugs that appeared with my
	last fix. And some more changes...

	- Slightly changed the conditions which cause the tools to be
	  re-initialized on button_press events and the global
	  initialisation functions.
	- The dialog tools now explicitly set tool->gdisp_ptr so they can
	  be properly hidden on display deletion.
	- Create the crop info dialog only once and avoid ugly redraw bugs
	  by blocking the sizeentries' signal when initializing them.
	- Standardized the tools_new_<tool>() functions. They are
	  scheduled to be moved to a common constructor in tools.c
	- Various stuff...

1999-06-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
	    Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* pixmap/eek.xpm: EEK. Some files unsaved. Quit the GIMP?

Fri Jun 25 22:09:04 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* lc_dialog.c

	Fixed problem when preview sizes are changed in L&C&P 
	dialog and then the busy cursors stuff tried to change 
	the cursor on a dialog that has been removed. (ie
	the LCP dialog should be unregistered when it is destroyed)

	Small previews in LCP dialog image menu do not get created when
 	no preview preference is set.

Thu Jun 24 18:13:35 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mkgen.pl
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: added a pattern rule to install
	single plugins

	* all plugin Makefiles: use $libexecdir instead of $pluginlibdir
	so we get installed on make install-exec

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_filter_iterators.c: removed old Colorify_iter_ALT
	reference

Thu Jun 24 22:49:41 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* layers_dialog.c
	* lc_dialog.c
	* lc_dialogP.h

	L&C&P previews are now updated on undo and layer movement
	operations.

Thu Jun 24 22:34:54 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap: some changes on request by the author Wolfgang Hofer
        * plug-ins/common/colorify.c: make it work on drawables with alpha 
	channel  

Wed Jun 23 17:55:58 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* more makefile fixes

Wed Jun 23 23:52:54 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* gimp/libgimp/gimpmenu.c 	
	* gimp/tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb
	* gimp/tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimage.pdb

	Added thumbnail image preview functions. 
	Previews are visible on the L&C&P dialogs as well as in the 
	drawables/channels/ menus generated for plugins 
	(see the bumpmap & Mapobject plugins). 

	PDB interface exists to simply extract a thumbnail preview 
	of a given size. This is much quicker & more efficient
	than getting the image data tile-by-tile if you only need a small
	image since a "preview cache" has been implemented. This cache also
	reduces the number of times the tiles cached is scanned since smaller
	previews are always generated from large ones if they exists and
	are valid.

	Some possible usages (I don't intend to implement these ideas. Just 
	suggestions). More plugins using the thumbnail preview (ie any that 
	use multiple images). Indication of "active image" somewhere.....
	Actually almost anywhere a drawable/image name appears.

1999-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/curves.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/histogram_tool.c
	* app/hue_saturation.c
	* app/levels.c
	* app/posterize.c
	* app/threshold.c:

	Factored out the cleaning up code to the tool dialog's "cancel"
	callbacks because they are called from every function which is
	aborting the tool. This should fix the remaining segfaults.

	I probably killed a feature of "Levels". The tool wanted to
	preserve it's drawable all the time, so it was possible to select
	colors from other displays. If this was the intended behaviour,
	please flame me and I will try to set the "preserve" flag
	correctly.

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: "struc" was in the Makefile but not
	in the directory.

Wed Jun 23 02:00:23 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plugin reorganization

Mon Jun 21 16:47:32 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/mpeg/mpeg.c: don't try to figure out G_BYTE_ORDER for
	ourselves

1999-06-21  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/context_manager.c: namespace cleanups.

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/menus.c: moved the "Toggle Selection" menu entry to "View",
	sprinkled some separators and made the layers/channels/paths popup
	menus consistent with Tigert's last ops buttons change.

	* app/fileops.c
	* app/plug_in.c: check for gdisplay_active() returning NULL in
	some more places.

	* app/[all tool related files]:

	- Turned the ToolAction and ToolState #define's into typedef'ed
	  enums, so the compiler can do some more sanity checking.
	- Removed one more unused global variable "active_tool_layer".
	- Removed some #include's from tools.c.
	- Standardized the individual tools' structure names.
	- Moved showing/hiding the tool options to separate functions.
	- Stuff...

	* app/commands.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/tools.c: fixed the segfaults which happened when the image
	of one of the tools which have dialogs (levels/posterize/...) was
	deleted. My approach was to do stricter sanity checking and to set
	some gdisplay pointers correctly where appropriate, so I can't
	tell exactly where the bug was.
	The curves tool now(??) updates on every _second_ display change
	only, which is really obscure.
	Finding/changing the display to operate on should definitely be
	done by connecting to the user context's "display_changed"
	signal.

	* app/gimpset.c: emit the "remove" signal _after_ removing the
	pointer from the set. If this was not a bug but a feature, please
	let me know, we'll need two signals then.

Mon Jun 21 12:51:15 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am: cosmetic change

	* app/plug_in.c: reordered #includes to prevent MAX/MIN conflict

	* app/menus.c: removed the weird translation code in favor of
	the item factory translation function. This may have broken some
	.po files.. we'll see. Also, added some more tearoffs and made
	tearoffs appear automagically when plugins register menu entries.

	* libgimp/gimpimage.c
	* libgimp/gimpenums.h: redid the GOrientation enum to match the
	app. Removed special casing in the handler.

	* plug-ins/guillotine/guillotine.c: small clean up

1999-06-21  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@interaktiivinen.satama.saunalahti.fi>

	* app/paths_dialog.c app/channels_dialog.c: changed the button 
	order so that the Delete button (trashcan) is always the rightmost
	button. Good for consistency. I hope nothing blows up because of
	this :)

1999-06-21  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: Changed the order of the layer ops buttons
	so that the delete button is on the right. Theoretically this should
	not break anything. :)

	I will do the same to the channels and paths too, just when I get
	time, which is probably later today.

1999-06-21  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.win32: Update version.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c: Include gimpcontext.h.

	* app/gdisplay.c: Don't pass a pointer as an int parameter,
	pass the result of an inequality comparison to zero.

	* app/makefile.msc: Add new files.

	* plug-ins/makefile.msc: Build the ps plug-in, too.

	* plug-ins/ps/ps.c: Add code to use a "real" output file, not a
 	pipe (needed with Win32 port of ghostscript).

	Use g_strdup_printf() instead of separate g_malloc() and sprintf()
 	calls. No need to check failure of g_malloc(), it aborts on
 	failure. Open files in binary mode.

	(Win32:) Use indirect command line file to guard for too long
 	command line. (Not sure if this is really needed.) Use the
 	gswin32c program.

1999-06-21  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/context_manager.c: connect to the user context's
	"display_changed" and to the image context's "remove" signal to
	avoid dangling references and to set the menu sensitivity on
	display change.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay_ops.c
	* app/gimpcontext.c
	* app/interface.[ch]: entirely moved the active display stuff to
	the user context:

	- The active display is set by any event in the display shell,
	  by File/New and File/Open.
	- gdisplay_delete() resets the active display to NULL if we
	  deleted the active display.
	- Reduced gdisplay_active() to a single statement returning the
	  context's active display. Should replace it by a macro.
	- gdisplay_flush_whenever() sets the menu sensitivity for the
	  active display.
	- Removed global variable popup_shell since it was only set all
	  the time but never used. I guess it's original job is now done
	  by the context anyway.
	- gdisplay_set_menu_sensitivity() works with gdisp == NULL.
	- There are mysterious Gdk-CRITICALs if both <Image> and one of
	  it's sub-menus are teared-off. Probably a gtk+ bug.

	To do all this stuff at a central place, there needs to be a
	GimpSet of displays (and ideally, GDisplay should be a GtkObject).

	* app/commands.c
	* app/lc_dialog.c: fixed segfaults happening with teared-off menus.

1999-06-21  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/delete.xpm: New icon for Delete (layer, path, channel etc..)
	One that represents a trashcan. Looks more 3ye C4nDy ;)
 
1999-06-20  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/lc_dialog.c
	* app/menus.c: applied a patch from <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>
	which implements tear-off-menus(!!!). Modified it to use the
	GimpContext.
	The sensitivity of the menu entries is not updated after 
	executing a command. This leaves the sensitivity in the state
	before the command was executed (which is buggy). Will probably
	have to update the sensitivity from gdisplays_flush().
	Simon called the patch "temporary" but it looks pretty stable to
	me. Please test it :-)

	* app/context_manager.[ch]: minor changes.

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: the user context keeps track of the
	current display and image. The image is set automatically from
	gimp_context_set_display().
	Still have to figure out how this should interact with
	gdisplay_active() (the current state is a hack).
	Made the context attributes real GtkObject arguments.
	Pass the changed attributes to the callbacks which connect to
	the <attribute>_changed signals.

	* app/gimpset.[ch]
	* app/gimpsetF.h
	* app/gimpsetP.h: made the gimpset properly derivable by adding
	signal slots to the object class structure. Added copyright
	headers.

	* app/gimpsignal.[ch]: new type gimp_sigtype_double, copyright
	header and my usual indentation fanaticism.

Sun Jun 20 14:55:14 1999  ape@gandalf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/xjt/xjt.c: <sys/types.h> before <sys/stat.h> to 
	remove compiler warning.

1999-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: added some functions. Still does nothing.

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/tools.[ch]: removed global variable active_tool_type
	because it was always equal to active_tool->type.

Thu Jun 17 22:32:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/flip_tool.c : Fixed flip tool bug - use FLIP_INFO rather than
	FLIP.

Thu Jun 17 20:05:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/devices.c : unbroke the devices previews.

1999-06-18  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/context_manager.[ch]: new files. Currently only init and
	destroy the static contexts (user, standard and default).

	* app/app_procs.c: call the context manager's init and free
	functions. Still have to figure out the right time to do this.

	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: alpha version 0.0.1 :-)

	Features:
	- Each context has a name
	- Attributes: opacity, paint mode, image, display
	- Signal emission on attribute change
	- Possibility to set a "parent" context
	- Each attribute can be defined or undefined. In the latter case
	  the values are taken from the parent context.
	- Possibility to pass a template and parent context to the
	  constructor
	Bugs:
	- Many attributes/functions still missing
	- It's connected to nothing

Fri Jun 18 18:25:24 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Fixed a problem with hidden/unaffected
	colour channels.

Fri Jun 18 10:55:46 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimpage.pdb
	* app/gimage_cmds.c: 
	fixed a bug in (gimp-image-floating-sel-attached-to)

	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm.c: changed the registered plug-in name so it
	follows the naming conventions

Thu Jun 17 22:30:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c : set usize on indexed color pallete, 
          so it has a height when started.

	* app/devices.c
	* app/indicator_area.c
	* app/interface.c: fixed so that --no-data and -n no longer crash
	or give ugly warnings on startup.  --no-data disables indicators.

Thu Jun 17 22:26:38 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: default to the old-fashioned behaviour (crop and 
	dont_enlarge)

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/paint_core.c
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/transform_core.c: implemented horizontal and vertical lines
	for the paint_tools using CTRL and MOD1. Changed the Scale tool to
	use the same modifiers. Complain if you don't like this!
	
	Now if I knew why MOD1 behaves differently than the other modifiers, 
	setting the cursor coordinates to 0,0 every time :-(

1999-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/gimpcontext.[ch]: new files. Does nothing yet. Checked in
	because I found some bugs while hacking it: 

	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]: fixed some cut & paste bugs and some
	gtk 1.0 artefacts in the object class initialisation code.

1999-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: the tree title doesn't behave like a
	button anymore.
	Made the thumbnail option look like the other option menus.

1999-06-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* README.win32: Mention using GNU gettext.

	* config.h.win32: Enable NLS stuff. Remove the X11 & Unix vs. Win32
	feature test macros, we use those from glibconfig.h and gdkconfig.h.

	* app/makefile.msc: Use gettext. New object files.

	* app/batch.c: No need to include <io.h> on Win32.

	* app/errorconsole.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/tile_swap.c: Include <glib.h> early to get Win32 feature
	test macros from <glibconfig.h>.

	* app/gimpset.c: Remove unnecessary (?) warning.

	* app/main.c
	* libgimp/stdplugins-intl.h: If no LOCALEDIR defined
	(as on Win32), use the "locale" subdir in gimp_data_directory().

	* app/palette.c: Open palette file in text mode.

	* app/session.c
	* app/text_tool.c: Use GDK's GDK_WINDOWING feature test macro
	if available, not WINDOWS_DISPLAY.

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.win32: Correct GIMP_VERSION.

	* libgimp/makefile.msc: Use gettext.

	* plug-ins/makefile.msc: Use gettext. Add some missing
 	plug-ins. Advice how to build "unofficial" plug-ins.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c
	* plug-ins/faxg3/faxg3.c
	* plug-ins/gbr/gbr.c
	* plug-ins/gz/gz.c: Include <glib.h> early.

	* plug-ins/tga/tga.c: Include config.h, use HAVE_UNISTD_H.

Sun Jun 13 21:05:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* app/devices.c
	* app/gimprc.[c,h]
	* app/interface.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Make the indicator area on the toolbar
	something that the user can turn off after a restart.  Currently it
	(and most other such fucntions) give no indication of error if user
	clicks OK and not Save - this needs to let the user know that changes
	will not take effect w/o a save.  It will not update once OK is clicked
	though, which is very much less than preferable behavior
	
	* app/indicator_area.c: fixed a bug that let the preview stay up if the
	user clicked, dragged, and refocussed on another widget
	 
Sat Jun 12 23:45:01 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* docs/parasites.txt: nicks comments...

Thu Jun 10 12:11:24 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* almost all the plug-in Makefiles: add $(INTLLIBS)

Tue Jun  8 10:56:42 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: Traverse the layers stack to know if there's 
	a prev/next layer. That way we know if the next layer has an alpha 
	channel and set the sensitivity of the up/down buttons correctly.

Tue Jun  8 01:12:31 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/flip_tool.c: Only install the tool cursor if we are inside a 
	selected region.

Tue Jun  8 00:30:57 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/paint_core.c: Overworked the line preview. Sorry for the 
	inconvenience, but it has always worked here due to a bug in icewm. 
	Should work much better now, also it still isn't perfect (yet).

	Had to change the standard toggle key for all toggleable tools to 
	<Ctrl> since <Shift> collides with line drawing in the Convolver tool.

1999-06-06  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/menus.[ch]: locale-wrapper for menus_set_sensitive (..._locale)
	  and menus_set_state (..._locale) which splits the menu-entry
	  "<Foo>/Bar/Baz" into "<Foo>" and "/Bar/Baz" to remove double
	  translations

Sun Jun  6 11:16:12 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* app/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/rcm/Makefile.am: various dist fixes

1999-06-06  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/lc_dialog.[ch]
	* app/lc_dialogP.h
	* app/paths_dialogP.h: new files

	* app/channels_dialog.[ch]
	* app/layers_dialog.[ch]
	* app/layers_dialogP.h
	* app/paths_dialog.[ch]
	* app/menus.[ch]
	* app/file_new_dialog.c: modified

	- Moved the toplevel L&C dialog code to lc_dialog.[ch]. Only
	  these files need knowledge about how to create/update/...
	  the sub-dialogs, so the corresp. functions are defined in
	  lc_dialogP.h.
	- The popup menus are now created by menus.c. The command
	  callbacks are defined in [layers|channels|paths]_dialog.h.
	- Private functions to be used by "friend files" are defined in
	  [layers|paths]_dialogP.h.
	- Changed the order of the ops_buttons in the paths dialog to
	  match the order in the layers and channels dialogs.
	- The paint mode menu and preview stuff still needs to go out of
	  layers_dialog.[ch].
	- I'm not sure about the keybindings in the layer dialog's "Stack"
	  submenu because the list widget has it's own idea of PageUp/Down.
	- Hopefully fixed the update problem with new images by calling
	  lc_dialog_flush() after creating a new image.

Sun Jun  6 17:22:16 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* fileops.c gimprc.c gimprc.h preferences_dialog.c:
	Preferences dialog now has an option for people who don't
	like thumbnail files to ever be written.

Sun Jun  6 15:41:22 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: Extra quality thumbnails when the user manually
	asks for one to be created.  Can now also generate one-shot
	previews for images on read-only media.

Sun Jun  6 14:19:08 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c

	Applied bezier/paths patches supplied by David LE CORFEC. 
	These fix a couple of segv. problems.

Sat Jun  5 17:03:15 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.6 release

1999-06-05  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* plug-ins/xjt/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Reorder to include
	$(top_srcdir) first.  This prevents rebuilding on `make install'.
	* plug-ins/struc/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Likewise.

	* po-plug-ins/Makefile.in.in: don't conflict with the app translation
	files

	* plug-ins/compose
	* plug-ins/decompose: updates

Fri Jun  4 19:00:12 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: version number bump to 1.1.6

	* added unsharp plug-in

	* app/indicator_area.c
	* app/main.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/paint_core.c: minor cleanups

	* plug-ins/wmf/wmf.c: s/memmove/g_memmove/

	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl: formatting changes, still unfinished

Sat Jun  5 02:17:02 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/screenshot/screenshot.c: I still don't know why this guy
 	did change the plug-in (99/05/13), but the layout he introduced 
	definitely sucked. I thought I would be known to be an active 
	developer, so if you want to change one of my plug-ins, please ask...
 
Fri Jun  4 22:07:56 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gckui.c (gck_application_window_new): 
	Removed 2 obsolete statements causing OS/2 to crash.
	The code was trying to update a static const structure!
	
Thu Jun  3 20:59:11 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* tips/Makefile.am
	* tips/gimp_tips.de.txt: (new file) German translation of the 
	tips_file. Someone needs to add this to de.po so it is used.

1999-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/disp_callbacks.[ch]
	* app/gimpset.c
	* app/interface.c: patch from <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>. Cleans up
	the active image implementation. Now the button and key events of
	the whole gdisplay shell are connected to a separate active image
	callback.

	Don't let the arrow button of the gdisplay grab the focus and
	block it's events after any button_press_event, so the canvas
	always owns the keyboard focus and the button never grabs the
	pointer.

	* app/gdisplay.c: correct sensitive setting for the Layers/Stack
	submenu.

	* app/interface.c: make the query boxes insensitive after pressing
	"OK" (may be useful if they're once used for operations which take
	longer than just shrink/grow/...).

	* app/layers_dialog.c: switch to the active image when the "Auto"
	button is activated.

	* app/menus.c: bound the <Image>/Layers/Stack menu to some
	<modifier>+PageUp/Down combinations.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: pop up with the "Interface" branch
	expanded.

Thu Jun  3 16:51:18 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_core.c: Improved the line draw preview a bit. It's still 
	not perfect, but should work better with respect to multiple modifiers
	being pressed. Prototyped all functions in paint_core.c while I was 
	on it.

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/ops_buttons.[ch]: Channels can now be intersected with the 
	active selection. Bound this to <Shift><Ctrl> and <Alt> when pressing
	the 'Channel to Selection'-button in the Channels dialog. Added 
	tooltips for all modifier functions.

Thur Jun 3 9:06:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/drop-shadow.scm: you can't
	use gimp-edit-fill until you've attached the drawable to 
	an image.
	
Thur Jun 3 1:43:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/indicator_area.[ch]
	* app/devices.c: Added a pattern preview and its popup.  This
	needs some GUI work still, as they are just way too big in a 
	general case.

Wed Jun  2 23:13:30 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/indicator_area.c : Added popup previews if the brush is bigger
	than the indicator area.

Wed Jun  2 19:43:30 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* TODO: Removed entries that have been accomplished.  Still
	lots in there for an eager hacker (of just about any skill level)

Wed Jun  2 16:53:30 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/docindex.c: remove unused var

	* app/gimprc_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimprc.pdb: propagate the May 21 change to the
	pdb file

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/{channel,gimage,layer}.pdb: don't be sloppy in
	the face of fickle perls

1999-06-03  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/about_dialog.c (about_dialog_load_logo): As we open the ppm
	file in binary mode, we shouldn't assume that the header lines
	read with fgets end with just a '\n'.

1999-06-02  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am : Added new Files, indicator_area.[ch]

	* app/devices.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/indicator_area.[ch] : Added a brush preview in the toolbar.  
	Still needs a full size preview, and could use a patterns and a 
	gradient next to it :)  These will happen, relatively soon.

	Thanks to the KDE guy (Torsten Rahn) on the gimp-devel mailing list 
	that gave the idea for this by pointing out that it wasn't easy 
	to find the size of the brush.  It seems obvious now.

1999-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gimpset.[ch]
	* app/gimpsetP.h
	* app/layers_dialog.c: applied Simon's <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>
	active image patch.
	GimpSet has an "active_changed" signal now. The image_context
	emits it whenever there is a button or key event in the gdisplay
	and the L&C dlg. connects to it for the new auto-update feature.

1999-06-01  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/menus.c: for the pleasure of all: a deeper nested	submenu ;)

	New <Image>/Layers/Stack submenu. Used the same top/bottom
	shortcuts as in the layers dialog. Bind them to PageUp/Down and
	you will never touch your mouse again to do this.
	I'm thinking of dropping the current <ctrl>+[FBTU] in favour of
	some <modifier>+PageUp/Down combinations. Test it, Tig !)

Tue Jun  1 12:07:57 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/xwd/xwd.c: hackaround for buggy window managers (like
	WindowMaker) that store a bogus XWDColor flag field.

1999-06-01  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.[ch]: renamed init_parse_buffers() to
	parse_buffers_init().

	* app/gimprc.[ch] (parse_gimprc_file): return a boolean indicating
	success to find out if sessionrc exists.

	* app/session.c: open L&C and Brushes on first gimp invocation to
	help first-time users.

Mon May 31 06:48:56 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * configure.in, README: Set the PREFIX env. var. to the value of
        --enable-perl.
        * docs/parasites.txt: updated.

1999-05-31  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/info_dialog.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c: fixed some very strange grid redraw bugs which
	were caused by unblocked sizeentry signals. It's generally a bad
	idea to connect to a sizeentry's signal before initialization.
	Removed the workaround for the gdk assert failures about
	"gc != NULL" because the signals were the real reason.

	* app/transform_core.c: originally wanted to fix the bug here but
	ended up with just some function headers made ansi compliant.

1999-05-31  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: Guess what? We now have an important indicator
	that reminds of the RIGHT MOUSEBUTTON MENU!! :)

1999-05-31  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/resize.[ch]
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/shear_tool.c: finished the float->double migration for
	resolution values. Standardized the order of function calls which
	initialize sizeentries. Fixed some off-by-one errors by using
	correct double->int casting. Use the g* counterparts of int and
	double in some places. Various code cleanups.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: same changes as above plus a cleaner
	implementation of the mem_size_unit stuff. The whole dialog should
	behave like before.

Sat May 29 23:43:56 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/stdplugins-intl.h: #include <locale.h>

	one out yourself!

Sat May 29 13:43:14 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: $srcdir != $builddir fix

Sat May 29 09:28:40 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* Makefile.am: removed tips files, AC_SUBST GIMP_PLUGINS and
	GIMP_MODULES so you can easily skip those parts of the build

	* acinclude.m4
	* config.sub
	* config.guess
	* ltconfig

	* app/fileops.c: shuffle #includes to avoid warning about MIN and

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: New splash - enjoy while it lasts..

1999-05-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	Merge in Win32 changes to plug-ins. Small Win32-related changes
	to app, libgimp and modules.

	* configure.in acconfig.h: Check for mmap.

	* app/makefile.msc: Depend on gimpi.lib.
	
	* app/app_procs.c (app_init): Fix gccism: Allocate filenames (an
	array with non-constant size) dynamically.

	* app/{datafiles,fileops,general,install,module_db,temp_buf}.c:
	Include glib.h before standard headers, because of certain obscure
	details related to compiling with gcc on Win32.

	(If you really want to know: glib.h defines he names of POSIXish
	(but non-ANSI) functions as prefixed with underscore, because
 	that's how they are named in the msvcrt runtime C library we want
 	to use. However, defining stat as _stat causes some problems if
 	done after including the mingw32 <sys/stat.h>. So, it's easiest to
 	include <glib.h> early.)

	* app/main.c: Use _stdcall and __argc, __argv with MSC, but
 	__attribute__((stdcall)) and _argc, _argv with gcc. Don't print
 	the "Passed serialization test" message on Win32. (It would open
 	up an otherwise unnecessary console window.)

	* app/paint_funcs.c (gaussian_blur_region): Don't use variable sum
 	until initialized.

	* app/{bezier_select,paths_dialog}.c: Include config.h and define
 	rint() if necessary.

	* app/plug_in.c: Use _spawnv, not spawnv, on Win32 and OS/2.
	
	* libgimp/gimp.c: No need for <io.h> on Win32.

	* libgimp/{gimp,gimpui}.def: Add two entry points.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: Can't use __declspec(dllexport) for PLUG_IN_INFO
 	when compiling with gcc on Win32. Also handle __argc, __argv and
 	_stdcall differently with gcc on Win32

	* libgimp/gimpenv.c: Include <string.h>.

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.in: Remove lots of extraneous trailing blanks.

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c: Include <glib.h> early, see above.

	* libgimp/{gimpwire,parasite}.c: Test for NATIVE_WIN32, not
	_MSC_VER.

	* libgimp/makefile.msc: Miscellaneous updates. The gimpi library
 	is now built as a static library.

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: No need to include gdkx.h. Define
	M_PI if needed.

	* modules/makefile.msc: Use GLib 1.3, update GTk+ paths.

	* plug-ins/makefile.msc: New file.

	* plug-ins/*/*.c (Well, not really all files, but many):
 	Portability fixes. Include config.h, and guard inclusion of POSIX
 	and Unix headers like <unistd.h>, <dirent.h> and
 	<sys/time.h>. Include <string.h> if functions from it are
 	used. Use g_ntohl() and g_htonl() insteead of ntohl() and htonl(),
 	thus no need to include <netinet/in.h>. Include <io.h> on Win32
 	when using open/read/write (which actually are defined as
 	_open/_read/_write by glib.h). Define S_* macros if necessary on
 	Win32. Define rint() and M_PI if necessary (these definitions
 	should be factored out somewhere, no sense repeating them in lots
 	of files). Open files in binary mode when needed.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c: Use
 	g_malloc()/g_free(). Use g_strdup_printf().

  	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/dbbrowser.c: No need to include <X11/Xlib.h>.

	* plug-ins/destripe/destripe.c: Guard use of SIGBUS.

	* plug-ins/{flame/flame,hrz/hrz,pnm/pnm}.c: No need to check for
 	NULL returns from g_malloc() and g_new() as they abort on failure.
	Use g_strdup_printf().

	* plug-ins/gz/gz.c: Win32 version of running the subprocess.

	* plug-ins/hrz/hrz.c: Win32 version. Use more generic tests for
 	non-Unix (OS/2 and Win32), for instance HAVE_MMAP.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Portability fixes. Use
 	g_strdup_printf() instead of separate malloc() and sprintf(). Use
 	g_strescape() for strings being passed to Scheme. Some Win32-only
 	stuff.

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: No need to include gdkx.h. Define
 	M_PI if necessary.

	* modules/makefile.msc: Update GLib and GTk+ version paths to
 	current preferences.

Thu May 27 22:00:58 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_core.c

	Bezier curve display during transformation works 
	with corrective type of transform.

Thu May 27 21:10:31 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/print/print-ps.c (ppd_find): use g_strncasecmp() instead
	of strncasecmp().

Thu May 27 12:10:46 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap/sel-to-anim-img.scm: bugfix as provided by Wolfgang
	Hofer, the GAP author

Thu May 27 01:59:35 1999  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* cursors/{mouse1_u,mouse1_umsk}: new mouse cursor for intersection
	operations.

	* app/cursorutil.[ch], app/rect_select.c: use the new cursor.

	* app/gimpimage.c:  Applied layer removal bug fix from
	David Le Corfec, <lecorfec@etudiant.univ-mlv.fr>

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/{font_selection.c, gdyntext.c, gdyntext_ui.c}:
	replaced snprintf with g_snprintf.

	* plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: updated to work with the double precision
	resolutions.

Wed May 26 21:14:15 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/bezier_selectP.h
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/transform_core.c
	* app/transform_core.h
	* app/transform_tool.c

	only the last selected path will be shown).

	Reduced flashing of control points during update drawing of paths. 

	Fixed problem in transform tool rotate/scale when changing
	layer (used to get many gdk assert failures about "gc != NULL")

Tue May 25 20:02:42 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/gdyntext_ui.c: Add include <sys/types.h> for OS/2

Mon May 24 21:16:14 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/faxg3/faxg3.c: 
	* plug-ins/faxg3/g3.c: Add include <sys/types.h> for OS/2

Sun May 23 14:13:03 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/threshold_alpha/threshold_alpha.c: Added
	support for greyscale drawables (why not?)

Sun May 23 13:37:53 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Removed bogosity of previous fix and
	optimized a little.  Cleaner, faster and hopefully more correct
	now.

Sun May 23 02:35:57 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Fixed a preserve-transparency
	bug w/blend tool and possibly elsewhere.  Allowed
	the opacity-quickskip rule to be applied more generously.

	Be a bit lazier with row-hint re-evalution (tnx j).

1999-05-22  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/[all files with resolution info]
	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c
	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpunit.[ch]
	* plug-ins/newsprint/newsprint.c
	* plug-ins/pgn/png.c
	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c: double instead of float for all resolution
	and unit-factor variables.

	* app/commands.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/move_tool.c
	* app/resize.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c: pass the image's unit *and* gdisp->dot_for_dot
	to all functions which create sizeentries. Never create a
	sizeentry with UNIT_PIXEL but with the image's unit and set it's
	unit to UNIT_PIXEL after creation if dot_for_dot is on.
	This way the image's unit can always be picked from the menu
	without selecting "More...".

	* app/interface.c: made the query_*_box() functions use the
	ActionArea.

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: GTK_WIN_POS_MOUSE for the unit
	selection dialog.

Fri May 21 10:39:00 CST 1999  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/gimprc_cmds.c : wrapped up value_to_str and added it to
            the gimprc_query function.  Now most values will be queryable,
            but there are still a few exceptions (generally structure info
            not really stored in gimprc anyway).

Thu May 20 16:38:05 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/curves.c: colour in the previously greyscale bars to the
	    left and below the curve itself.  Might want to take alpha and
	    value into account, but currently we don't.  Incidentally
	    fixes a few redraw problems I found along the way.  Done in
	    about an hour and a half, to show Wavey Dave what's possible :)

Wed May 19 19:48:10 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c : 
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c:  OS/2 patches.

	* plug-ins/bz2/bz2.c: OS/2 patches. spawn(),,

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_mov_dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gap/gap_split.c: bugfixes as provided by Wolfgang Hofer

Mon May 17 16:56:36 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: New function gimp_pixel_rgns_register2.
        * libgimp/gimp.h: Add prototype for the above.
        * libgimp/gimpfeatures.h: Add feature test macro for the above.

Tue May 18 22:53:08 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>	

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Changed the layout of the
	action-area to follow the gimp conventions. I intentionally wanted
	to fix the broken gradient select widget, but couldn't find where
	the problem is located. Ideas anyone??

Tue May 18 20:28:42 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/gz/gz.c (spawn_gzip): OS/2 patches. spawn(),,

1999-05-18  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/app_procs.c (and many of the files below): store resolution
	values as doubles, not floats.

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c: hide the "refresh" button in client
	dialogs. Don't know if this is desired but it fixes a SEGV.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c: New ui using code/ideas from Austin,
	Marco and Nick. The "size" frame is still a bit bloated but I
	didn't want to reduce it's functionality right now. It's closer to
	the result of the last discussion but not perfect yet...
	Added a dialog to confirm image sizes larger than the new
	max_new_image_size value.
	The new "reset" button uses the values from gimprc.
	Removed some #include's, added the copyright header.

	* app/gimprc.[ch]: new rc variable max_new_image_size.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: added the "max image size"
	option. Generalized the mem size unit code.

	* app/resize.c: an additional box lets the offset widget always
	shrink correctly.

	* app/text_tool.c: fixed a minor memory leak.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: add all widgets to libgimpui.*

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c: cosmetic changes.

	* libgimp/gimplimits.h: a maximum image size which should satisfy
	everybody ;)

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: allow the creation of sizeentries
	without fields. This (finally) enables arbitrary layout of the
	spinbuttons.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: use the fileselection
	widget for script parameter SF_FILENAME.

Tue May 18 01:14:55 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: run cleanup code on shutdown in many more
	    cases.  The should fix Marc's problem of not getting module
	    unload functions called at quit time.

	* app/gimprc.c: internal "module-load-inhibit" variable, listing
	    modules to ignore at start of day.
	* app/module_db.c: new rc file: modulerc.  Keep track of which
	    modules we've got inhibited.  Add button to module browser to
	    edit the settings.  Save new version on gimp exit.

1999-05-17  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am (../libgimp/gimpfeatures.h): Dummy rule,
	redirected to `gimpfeatures.h'.  This should prevent building
	stuff twice when `gimpfeatures.h' changes.

Mon May 17 14:25:11 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/mail/mail.c (save_image): Add OS/2 patches. popen(),spawnl,,

1999-05-17  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/xcf.c: fixed bogus computation of the maximum size
 	of a compressed tile in xcf_load_level and xcf_save_level.

1999-05-16  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* plug-ins/displace/displace.c (run): Fixed a dumb typo reported
	on gimp-developer by Claes G. Lindblad.

Sun May 16 22:54:23 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/xd/xd.c: Add OS/2 patches. include <sys/types.h>,,,

Thu May 13 19:17:58 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimp.[ch]: Implement gimp_default_display.
        * libgimp/gimpfeatures.h: Add feature test macro for the above.

Sun May 16 18:23:12 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/module_db.c: We weren't initialising refs variable before using
	    it.  Hence some stuff was being prematurely unloaded.  D'oh!

	* app/menus.c: move Module DB browser to the Xtns menu, since it
	    seems to make more sense being there.

	* cursors/droppermsk: slight improvement over current one, but
	    really needs proper artist to look at it.

Sun May 16 17:16:59 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Fixed a possible bad composite when
	mode is REPLACE_MODE.

1999-05-15  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/about_dialog.c: Removed unnecessarly #include of
	interface.h.

	* app/crop.c (crop_image): Fixed a potential linked list race
	condition (i.e. accessing freed memory) when cropping deletes a
	layer.  May fix a bug reported by Sven.

Sat May 15 14:11:46 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/clone.c
	* app/paint_core.c: handle the clone tool differently (works as
	usual without the line preview) until I figure out something 
	nicer.

Sat May 15 03:15:49 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_core.c: Works even better if the cursor position is
	correctly transformed ;-)

Sat May 15 01:55:12 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: Moved the seperator down so that it seperates the MRU
	dialog from the rest.
	* app/paint_core.c: Show the line you are drawing when using <Shift>
	on paint_tools. Still need to figure out what's different about the
	clone tool...
	* app/blend.c
	* app/cursorutil.c
	* app/paintbrush.c: a little bit of code cleanup while I was on it

Sat May 15 00:06:06 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.h

	Fixed problem where paths preview not resized correctly when
	image was resized.

1999-05-13  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/pencil.c: use the new color picking feature of paint_core.

Thu May 13 22:41:26 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-
	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/bezier_selectP.h
	* app/cursorutil.c
	* app/cursorutil.h
	* app/curves.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c

	New:- 
	* cursor/mouse1_ap
	* cursor/mouse1_apmsk
	* cursor/mouse1_cp
	* cursor/mouse1_cpmsk
	* cursor/mouse1_mm
	* cursor/mouse1_mmmsk
	* cursor/mouse1_sel
	* cursor/mouse1_selm
	* cursor/mouse1_selmmsk
	* cursor/mouse1_selmsk
	* cursor/mouse1_selp
	* cursor/mouse1_selpmsk

	Paths changes:-
	Implemented multi-part paths. 
	(Import the path (RMB in paths dialog brings menu up) 
	http://www.picnic.demon.co.uk/tmp/gimp.path 
	into a 600x256 (WxH) for an example).

	Can copy/paste paths. 
	Fully custom cursors when using the Bezier tool. A number of bug 
	fixes re boundary problems also fixed.

	Note that heavy use is made of the modifier keys in the bezier tool.
	MB1 inside a closed curve converts it to a selection. The modifiers
	change how the selection interacts with any current selection (in
	much the same way as the selection tool does).

	MB1 + ALT on control point will move a curve, if shift modifier active
	then single curve is moved.
	
	
	Curves:-

	In curves dialog you can now press MB1 + shift will add point to 
	curves dialog corresponding to the current position in 
	the currently selected channel. MB1 + CNTRL will add the point
	to all channels. (Thanks to Carey Bunks for the initial idea).

1999-05-13  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_core.[ch]: set the fg or bg color if ctrl or alt is
 	held.  use the new dropper cursor.

	* app/cursorutil.[ch], app/gdisplay.[ch], app/rect_select.c: Use
 	GimpCursorType enum values > GDK_CURSOR_LAST instead of seperate
 	functions to choose between cursor types.

	* app/color_picker.c: use the new dropper cursor.

	* app/paintbrush.c, app/airbrush.c, app/paintbrush.c: use the new
 	color picking feature of paint_core.

	* cursors/dropper, cursors/droppermsk: new cursor for the color
 	picker tool. (this cursor is REALLY ugly, someone should fix it)

1999-05-12  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* configure.in: fixed variable clobber for thread & MP options 
	* app/Makefile.am: added new GIMP_MP_{LIBS,FLAGS} to compile &
	link flags

	The old configure would set the thread libs and then immediately
	clobber them unless you enabled MP support.  This meant threads
	but no MP would mean a no-compile if your pthread support is in a
	separate library (not in libc).

1999-05-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* plug-ins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Make the "after ... seconds"
	option global since it is also useful if you want to take a shot
	of a very large window.

Wed May 12 12:13:57 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acinclude.m4: minor typo fix

	* configure.in: remove waterselect plugin

	* gtkrc: yellow tooltips

Wed May 12 15:14:25 EEST 1999 Lauri Alanko <nether@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: Updated calls to gimp_paintbrush to its
 	current pdb interface.
		
Mit Mai 12 01:16:07 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/waterselect: removed

Tue May 11 22:32:22 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/color.pdb
	* app/color_cmds.c: fixed some cut'n'paste errors

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scrips/slide.scm: do the rotation correctly

Tue May 11 11:43:36 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_water.c: small change not worth a ChangeLog entry

Mon May 10 18:28:11 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * configure.in: undo the part of patch "Tue May 4 15:51:16 PDT
        1999" which broke gimp-perl configuration completely.

Mon May 10 18:59:58 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_water.c: finally fixed my prob all by myself :)

Sun May  9 23:45:08 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_water.c: Added a pressure slider. Still don't 
	know why the color history is initially drawn in black and is not 
	updated properly.

1999-05-09  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/text_tool.c: made the font selection dialog static again, so
	the selected font is remembered across text tool invocations.

1999-05-09  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimplimits.h: new file. Currently contains constants for
	image size and resolution.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/resize.c: use the new constants.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: use a sizeentry in the "New Layer" query
	box. Folded the "Layer Fill Type" callbacks into one function.

	* app/text_tool.c
	* app/text_tool_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: did the calculations for
	resolutions < 1.0 right this time.

	* app/gimage_cmds.c
	* tool/pdbgen/pdb/gimage.pdb: fixed a typo.

Sun May  9 16:23:47 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/tile.c
	* app/tile.h
	* app/tile_manager.c
	* app/tile_pvt.h
	* app/paint_funcs.c:

	Added Tile Row Hinting to the GIMP tile structure.  Tiles
	now have cheap per-row hints indicating whether each row is
	all-transparent, all-opaque, a mixture, or other properties.

	These hints are automatically invalidated when the tile is checked
	in as dirty, and are re-evaluated on demand.

	Currently only the layer compositing routines take advantage
	of these hints, though there is opportunity to use them to
	advantage in numerous other places.

	The whole layer compositing process is typically 2x-4x faster
	now, especially on subsequent renders of data which has already
	had its hints calculated.

	See tile.h for the explicit TileRowHint query/set interface.
	The procedure to re-evaluate tile hints currently resides in
	paint_funcs.c but may be exposed to other parts of the core
	if necessary.

	This is experimental.  Please report mis-rendering problems.

Sat May  8 22:38:03 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: new splash_screen ...

Sat May  8 18:31:04 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/Makefile.am
	* modules/colorsel_water.c: Implemented the waterselect plug-in
	as a colorselect module. There is a strange bug left with the update
	of the previews in the color history. Any help is appreciated!
	I'll let the plug-in in the distribution until this is fixed.

1999-05-07  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/docindex.[ch]: fill the "last opened" list with
	the first last_opened_size elements of the docindex.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: fixed the tile_cache_size and
	last_opened_size bugs. Now we can change these values again.

1999-05-07  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/channel.[ch]
	* app/commands.c
	* app/gimage_mask.[ch]
	* app/gimage_mask_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimage_mask.pdb
	* app/interface.c: propagated the independent x/y values for
	shrink/grow/border to the interface but not yet to the PDB.

	* app/*_select.c
	* app/paint_funcs.[ch]: implemented indep. x/y feather. It seems
	that cut-and-paste was sufficient, but I didn't really understand
	the code. Jay, could you have a look at this please?

	If the feather/shrink/... amount is specified in pixels,
	everything behaves like before.
	I'm not sure how the built-in feather option of the selection
	tools should behave, so it still defaults to 'pixel' mode.
	Moved the static feather/shrink/... values from gimage_mask.c to
	commands.c because they belong to the interface.

	* app/text_tool_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: prepared for resolution
	support, but didn't enable it yet.

	* app/unit_cmds.c
	* tool/pdbgen/pdb/unit.pdb: fixed a help text.

Thu May  6 22:51:33 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/plug_in.c (plug_in_init_shm): Added this new function.
	Taken from plug_in_init(). No logic is changed.

1999-05-06  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_select.pdb: Fix nasty bug, inner block
 	variable "values" shadowed outer one, the inner one was assigned
 	to, the outer one returned.

	* app/gradient_select_cmds.c
 	(gradients_get_gradient_data_invoker): Autogenned from above.

Wed May  5 18:18:16 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

        * configure.in: enabled _NOUI versions of GIMP_CFLAGS and
        GIMP_LIBS.

Wed May  5 14:29:51 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/datafiles.c: Add <sys/types.h>.
	* app/patterns.c: <sys/types.h> before <dirent.h>

Wed May  5 12:40:54 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* app/cursorutil.c: Moved the cursors out of 'pixmaps' into a new
	directory 'cursors'. Added the files to the Makefile.
	Now its up to TigerT to provide a set of rocking cursors for us ;-)

1999-05-05  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* pixmaps/mouse1*: new bitmap files containing the new mouse
 	cursors. (based on the work of Tuomas Kuosmanen)

	* app/parasitelist.c: use g_str_equal instead of parasite_compare_func.

	* app/paint_core.c: interpret perfectmouse right way round.

	* app/rect_select{P,}.[ch]: set custom cursors when the operation type
 	changes.  Centralize the calculation of op based on the modifier
 	keys being held.

	* app/fuzzy_select.c, app/free_select.c: allow the rect_select
 	functions calculate the operation type.

	* app/ellipse_select.c: use the SelectionOps typedefs.

	* app/edit_selection.c: convert MaskToLayerTranslate into
 	FloatingSelTranslate if there is already a floating selection in
 	init_edit_selection.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: fixed the calculation of state.

	* app/gdisplay.[ch], app/cursorutil.[ch]: new functions to allow
 	the loading of customized cursors.

	* app/paint_funcs.[ch], app/channel.c: border_region now accepts
 	seperate xradius and yradius arguments.

Tue May  4 15:51:16 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: use the sinclude bit again, since it works in
	automake 1.4. Generate the Makefile in the embed dir too

	* app/gimp.sym: new file, list the symbols we want export to 
	modules here

	* app/Makefile.am: add -export-symbols to LDFLAGS

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: use make variable expansion instead of
	direct substitution for optional plug-in dirs. E.g., now one can
	do "make GIMP_PERL=" to skip the perl plug-in dir during build
	without rerunning configure

	* plug-ins/rcm/Makefile.am: add header files to SOURCES

Tue May  4 15:16:47 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool.c: s@gdkprivate@gdk/gdkprivate@

1999-05-04  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	Win32 portability changes:

	* config.h.win32, README.win32: Small changes.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/*.pdb: Include <string.h>.

	* app/*_cmds.c: Autogenerated files reflect above changes.

	* libgimp/makefile.msc app/makefile.msc: Various updates,
 	including new object files. Gtk+ directory now should be called
 	gtk+ (not gtk-plus). Use win32-specific gdk subdir. Glib directory
 	now should be called just glib.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: Updates.

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.win32: Made current with
 	gimpfeatures.h.in.

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c: Define S_ISDIR and S_ISREG if
 	necessary.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: Must have a
 	statement (even an empty one) after a label.

	* app/fileops_cmds.c: Autogenerated file reflects above changes.

	* app/crop.c: Include <string.h>.

	* app/{app_procs,batch,fileops,datafiles,errorconsole,general,
 	plug_in,temp_buf,tile_swap}.c: Test NATIVE_WIN32, not
 	_MSC_VER. (NATIVE_WIN32 means we are using the Microsoft C
 	runtime, even if we might be compiling with gcc.)

	* app/fileops.c: Don't include <process.h> here.

	* app/fileops.h: Do include <process.h> here.

	* app/gimpparasite.c: Include config.h, guard inclusion of
 	<unistd.h>. (Is the inclusion of unistd.h in source files all over
 	the place really necessary?)

	* app/ink.c: MSC doesn't handle conversion from unsigned __int64
 	to double, so cast to signed.

	* app/lut_funcs.c: Include config.h, and define rint() if necessary.

	* app/pixel_processor.c: Include config.h without "..", like in
 	all the other places. Include <string.h>

	* app/text_tool.c: Guard the "POINTS" identifier that clashes with
 	<windows.h>, sigh.

1999-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/commands.c: call gdisplays_resize_cursor_label(gimage)
	after changing the image's unit.

	* app/gdisplay.c: update the cursor label after resizing it's
	frame, so the old (wrong) value gets overwritten.

	* app/resize.c: it makes more sense to take the image's unit from
	the "print size" frame rather than from "pixel dimensions".
	Set reasonable boundaries to avoid over/underflows with crazy
	resolutions. Code and gui cleanup.
	The constants for min/max image size/resolution should probably go
	to a central place.

	* app/text_tool.c: set the resolution in the X font spec only if
	the size is specified in points (reported by Austin).

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: fixed a bad bug in the boundary and
	resolution setting code (was not noticable before the new
	resize/scale ui).

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/*: version 1.4.3

	* plug-ins/png/png.c: gcc suggested parentheses.

Mon May  3 15:38:54 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.5 release

Mon May  3 15:34:37 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb: progress_init takes an int32, not
	a display...

Mon May  3 14:03:35 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimage.pdb: fix rotten regexp eval
	
Mon May  3 21:44:27 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/palette.c: put up messages telling user about corrupted
 	    palette files as we load them.  In particular, try and catch
 	    MSDOS format files such as those distributed from Visibone's
 	    website.

Mon May  3 21:30:46 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: changed order of cflags and library path in
        GIMP_CLFAGS and GIMP_LIBS.

Mon May  3 12:04:47 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/plug_in.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/interface.pdb: new files

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: add no_id_lookup option

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: added new pdb files, plug_in.h

	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: plug_in.h enums

	* app/plug_in.[ch]: removed PDB stuff, exported current_plug_in,
	proc_defs, and plug_in_progress_{init,update}

	* app/interface_cmds.c
	* app/plug_in_cmds.c
	* app/internal_procs.c: pdbgenned files

	* app/Makefile.am: new files: interface_cmds.c, plug_in_cmds.c

Sun May  2 14:56:52 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.h: guide types used to start at 1, so make them
	start at 1

	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl
	* app/guides_cmds.c: autogenned files reflect above change

1999-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/resize.[ch]: new scale/resize ui:
	Use size entries instead of text entries, chainbuttons instead of
	check buttons. Put the stuff into frames. Added labels for the
	original width and height.
	It's possible to change resolution/unit now, please test if it
	does the right thing.

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: allow lower == upper when checking
	boundaries.

Sat May  1 14:43:42 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb
	* app/fileops_cmds.c: fixed dumbass save code

Sat May  1 22:18:55 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/brush_select.h
	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.h: delay the popup of pattern and brush
 	    preview window by 150 millisecs.  Allows flicker-free
 	    selection of brushes/patterns, and still have fast pattern
 	    preview like we used to.  Ideally, should really factor out
 	    the common code in these two files into one generic picker
 	    widget.

	* app/free_select.c: cosmetic whitespace change.

	* app/draw_core.c: use GDK_CAP_NOT_LAST, not GDK_CAP_BUTT,
 	    otherwise sequential line segments in XOR mode have
 	    single-pixel gaps between them.  Worse, if the segments are
 	    only one pixel long, you don't get _any_ lines.  XFree86 seems
 	    to ignore GDK_CAP_BUTT, which is why this bug hasn't been seen
 	    before.  NCD X servers comply with the spec a little more
 	    pedantically, so need GDK_CAP_NOT_LAST.  OS/2 and Win32 people
 	    should check that (eg) the lasso tool still provides proper
 	    visual feedback.

Sat May  1 12:14:54 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acinclude.m4
	* config.guess
	* config.sub
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: upgrade to libtool 1.3

	* Makefile.am: don't install gimprc.5 in our sharedir

Sat May  1 11:05:02 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/print/print.c (get_printers): OS/2 printing.

	* plug-ins/ps/ps.c (read_pnmraw_type): skip '\r';
	* plug-ins/screenshot/screenshot.c (shoot): Use spawnlp() instead of
 	fork().

	* plug-ins/hrz/hrz.c (load_image): Use g_malloc instead of mmap
	for OS/2.

Fri Apr 30 17:01:01 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

        * app/module_db.c (mod_load): only OS/2 patches.

Fri Apr 30 13:31:14 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: listed tools first in SUBDIRS, so xgettext can grab
	the autogenned files

	* acconfig.h: removed unused HAVE_XSHM_H

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: added proc invoke method, nicer header
	formatting

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: use layer_mask type for return value
	for layer_create_mask

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/misc.pdb: added quit proc

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: added ink proc, but not added to @procs
	since it's incomplete

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: new file

	* app/Makefile.am: added fileops_cmds.c

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/fileops.c

	* app/procedural_db_cmds.c
	* app/text_tool_cmds.c
	* app/internal_procs.c: pdbgen updates

	* app/paint_funcs.c: the glibc 2.1 docs say using SVID threadsafe
	random functions are preferable to rand_r, so use them instead of
	a mutex

1999-04-30  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/*: updated version 1.4.2

1999-04-30  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/flip_tool.c: fixed a cut-and-paste bug: vertical flip
	iterates over rows, not columns.

Thu Apr 29 16:32:11 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/url/url.c (load_image): 
	* plug-ins/webbrowser/webbrowser.c (start_browser): 
	Use spawnlp() instead of fork().

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c : OS/2 patches.
 	use G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR_S instead of ":", add sys/types.h,,.

1999-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select.[ch]: disabled setting the size of the
	brushes dialog again because it still caused SIGFPE's in some rare
	cases. I'm trying to fix that.
	*Minimal* ui spacing changes. Some changes to make the code look
	more similar (I'm a make-them-look-the-same fanatic ;)

Wed Apr 28 20:53:18 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/ops_buttons.c
	* app/tool_options.c: some code cleanup and i18n fixes

Wed Apr 28 16:28:08 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/gimprc.c: Add <sys/types.h>, Open text files with "rt".
	Add OS/2 function  add_x11root_token (char *x11root).

	* app/install.c (install_run): Add install for OS/2.

Tue Apr 27 23:52:26 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* tools/Makefile.am
	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: integrated pdbgen into the build system

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: renamed gimp_image_findnext_guide to
	gimp_image_find_next_guide, so change pdb wrapper

	* plug-ins/guillotine/guillotine.c: reflect api change

Tue Apr 27 22:59:08 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tool_options.c
	* app/tool_options_ui.h: redid the tool_options_radio_buttons_new
	function I introduced yesterday

	* app/interface.c: had to add GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK to the 
	events the window catches. Hopefully this doesn't break anything.

	* app/tools.c
	* app/tools.h
	* app/toolsF.h: decided that it makes more sense to have a 
	modifier_key_func instead of a toggle_key_func. That way we can
	catch all modifiers. Now if someone knows how to handle non-GDK 
	cursors, please implement context-cursors for the selection tools.

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/flip_tool.c: adapted to use the new modifier_key_func

	* all other tools: changed to use standard_modifier_key_func

	* app/internal_procs.[ch]: finally pdbgenned

	* app/channels_dialog.c

	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.[ch]
	* app/flip_tool.[ch]: Made these tools toggleable.

	* all other tools: added a standard_toggle_key_func.
	
Mon Apr 26 16:05:55 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: 
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c: 
	MAIN macro at the end of file.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c: 
	* plug-ins/CML_explorer/CML_explorer.c: Add <sys/types.h>.

Sun Apr 25 21:25:23 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c:  Add <sys/types.h>.
	 Use G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR_S instead of ":".

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c: Add <sys/types.h>

Sun Apr 25 16:59:09 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	as a persistant parasite if the comment was edited.

1999-04-25  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/text_tool.c: added resolution support if the tool is used
	from the interface. Can't do this for the PDB because the text has
	to be rendered in the size "text_get_extents" (which currently has
	no access to resolution information) returns.

Sat Apr 24 18:36:04 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_mask_cmds.[ch]: pdbgenned, use header file

	* app/internal_procs.c: use pdbgen register for gimage mask funcs

	* app/Makefile.am: remove gimage_mask_cmds.h

Sat Apr 24 21:50:58 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/edit_selection.c: Finished the opaque-move stuff...
	hopefully.  Float and selection-mask movement behaviour
	repaired, etc.

	* libgimp/gimp.h (MAIN): Add MAIN macro for OS/2 plugins.

1999-04-24  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/bucket_fill.c: added a "BG Color Fill" radio button.
	Toggling FG/BG with <shift> works in both color fill modes now.

	* app/brush_select.c: session management sets the size of the
	dialog again (depending on the current paint options mode because
	bad things happen if the brush preview's size is reduced beyond
	it's minimum).

Thu Apr 22 22:14:02 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpdrawable.c: gave parasite undo a MISC_UNDO class for now
	so it compiles

	* app/tools_cmds.c: fix crop invoker to give correct args to 
	crop_image

	* app/color_cmds.c: s/GRAY/GRAY_LUT/g;

	* app/general.c: 
	* app/errorconsole.c: Add <sys/types.h>

1999-04-23  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brush_select.[ch]
	* app/pattern_select.[ch]: made the previews change their size in
	sync with resizing the dialog. The previews auto-resize with their
	parent frame now. Connect to the preview's "size_allocate" signal,
	not to the frame's, don't "signal_connect_after". Get the size of
	the preview from it's allocation and not from it's requisition.
	There's no need to remember width, height and the frame in the
	structures anymore, so I kicked them out. Tweaked the code to look
	more similar.

Fri Apr 23 08:31:50 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: <sys/types.h> before <sys/stat.h>

	* app/paint_core.c: remove the alt toggles perfectmouse behaviour.

	* app/paintbrush.c: when ctl (or alt) is held set the fg (or bg) color.

	* app/gimpparasite.[ch]: made char *name parameters const.

	* app/parasitelist.c: removed unused static variable.

	* app/gimpdrawable.c, app/gimpimage.c, app/undo.[ch]: added
 	support for undoing parasite changes.

 	gimp_undo_push_group_start and gimp_undo_push_group_end

	* libgimp/parasite.[ch]: added undoable flag.

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/font_selection.c: fixed c++ style comment.

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/gdyntext.c: use the new undoable parasites.

	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_misc.c: arctg can't be inline because it is
 	used in other .c files

	* plug-ins/waterselect/waterselect.c,
	* plug-ins/rotators/rotators.c, app/tips_dialog.c, app/plug_in.c:
 	fixed some warnings

	* app/crop.c: autocrop used to miss the bottom line
	* plug-ins/autocrop/autocrop.c: same fix here

1999-04-22  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	First version of per-tool paint options. No PDB interface yet.
	The tool options dialog got rather big when in per-tool mode, so
	it will probably have to become a notebook.

	It's not yet 100% consistent. If switched off, everything should
	behave exactly like before.

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/paint_options.h: new file

	* app/tool_options.c: PaintOptions gui. Maintain a list of all
	paint tools' ToolOptions to enable switching between global and
	per-tool paint options.

	* app/brush_select.[ch]: changed packing boxes, tables, ...
	The paint options in the brush selection can be hidden now.
	Moved create_paint_mode_menu() to paint_options.h and
	tool_options.c and renamed it to paint_mode_menu_new().

	* app/gimage_mask.c
	* app/gimpbrush.[ch]
	* app/gimpbrushlist.[ch]
	* app/paint_core.c: moved gimp_brush_[set|get]_spacing() from
	gimpbrushlist.[ch] to gimpbrush.[ch].
	Moved gimp_brush_[get|set]_[opacity|paint_mode]() to
	paint_options.h and tool_options.c and renamed them to
	paint_options_*_*().  They are "global paint options" now.

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/eraser.c
	* app/ink.c
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/pencil.c: all paint tools' options are derived from
	"PaintOptions" now. Opacity and paint mode are obtained through
	macros which take into account the current paint options mode.

	* app/buildmenu.h: #include <gtk/gtk.h>

	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/text_tool.c: changed spacings.

	* app/gimprc.[ch]: new gimprc option "global-paint-options"

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Added a "Tool Options" page. Code
	cleanup. Some work on the convenience constructors test site.

	* app/tools.c: fixed "unused variable" warning.

Thu Apr 22 16:05:10 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* plug-ins/CEL/CEL.c: 
	* plug-ins/sharpen/sharpen.c: Use MAIN() macro.

Thu Apr 22 08:47:50 1999  ape@.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c: Add #include <sys/types.h> for OS/2 v.

Wed Apr 21 00:36:03 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: only add file to the 'recently opened' list if
	    it's not there already.

Tue Apr 20 21:53:01 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_cmds.c: moved a bunch of PDB stuff here

	* app/color_balance.[ch]: removed PDB proc, exported TransferMode
	enum, ColorBalanceDialog, color_balance_create_lookup_tables, and
	color_balance

	* app/curves.[ch]: removed PDB procs, exported SMOOTH and GFREE
	#defines, CurvesDialog, curves_lut_func and curves_calculate_curve

	* app/desaturate.[ch]: removed PDB proc, exported desaturate

	* app/equalize.[ch]: removed PDB proc, exported equalize

	HueSaturationDialog, hue_saturation_calculate_transfers,
	hue_saturation

	* app/invert.[ch]: remove PDB proc, export invert

	* app/lut_funcs.h: add ALPHA_LUT to ChannelLutType

Wed Apr 21 01:21:55 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: optimized the autocrop algorithm

Tue Apr 20 23:38:26 BST 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c: add the new args to gimp-paintbrush PDB
	    calls.

	* app/blend.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/invert.c: check return from procedural_db_run_proc() rather
	    than dereferencing NULL.

	* app/paintbrush.c: plumb the non-gui fade_out option into the
	    functions that actually do the work, rather than using
	    an uninitialised value.

	* app/procedural_db.c: better error messages on PDB typecheck fail
	    in procedural_db_run_proc.  Also now valid to
	    procedural_db_destroy_args() on a NULL pointer.
	* app/procedural_db.h: pdb_type_name() function added, plus
	    comment urging people to keep the enum and strings in step.

	* tools/pdbgen/README: added paragraph on how to run pdbgen.pl

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/tools.pdb: fade_out parameter is valid to be 0
	* app/tools_cmds.c: new version of generated file

Tue Apr 20 21:18:10 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c: moved the "Adaptive supersampling" option into
	the frame
	* app/transform_tool.c: sensitive setting for the "Grid density"

Tue Apr 20 10:05:07 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/tools_cmds.c: doh, I'm dumb. s/rotate_invoker/rotate/g

Tue Apr 20 13:09:03 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c
	* app/tips_dialog.c: put the previews into sunken frames

	* app/color_select.c: enlarged the hex triplet entry

Tue Apr 20 00:48:18 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: bump minimum perl version from 5.004 to 5.004_4.

Mon Apr 19 23:31:17 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap: Changes to the GAP plug-in as they were sent to
	me by Wolfgang Hofer.

1999-04-19  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/penstroke.xpm: Punched a hole inside the icon - it 
	shouldnt be filled I guess..

	* pixmaps/yes.xpm, pixmaps/no.xpm: Changed the icons (X and V) 
	to the ones that are also used in gnome - we can look more
	consistent this way  :)

1999-04-19  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* plug-ins/png/png.c: applied gimp-ruth-990413-0.patch. Modified
	it to leave the image's unit untouched because png has only
	resolution and no unit info. Fixed some unrelated warnings.

Sun Apr 18 14:19:36 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/tools_cmds.c: new file, containes the PDB stuff for most
	of the tools

	access

	* app/Makefile.am: added tools_cmds.c and gimprc_cmds.c

	* app/airbrush.[ch]
	* app/blend.[ch]
	* app/bucket_fill.[ch]
	* app/by_color_select.[ch]

	* app/rect_select.c app/rect_select.h
	* app/rotate_tool.[ch]
	* app/scale_tool.[ch]
	* app/shear_tool.[ch]: bye bye PDB stuff (exported necessary enums
	functions, vars, etc.)

	* app/internal_procs.c: use register_foo functions

	* app/blend.[ch]: GradientType enum case changed

	* app/bucket_fill.[ch]: s/FillMode/BucketFillMode/, made the enum
	more consistent

	* app/clone.[ch]: capitalized the CloneType enum

	* app/color_picker.[ch]: changed get_color to pick_color so we don't
	conflict with colormaps.c get_color

	* app/convolve.[ch]: capitalized the ConvolveType enum

	* app/paint_core.h: made a GradientPaintMode enum

	* app/transform_core.h: BoundingBox enum

	* app/scale_tool.c: use the generic bounding box enum for X1, Y1, etc.

	* app/shear_tool.[ch]: turned HORZ and VERT into a ShearType enum

1999-04-18  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
    
	* app/internal_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/gimprc.c: wrote a function to save arbitrary "token" "value"
	pairs in the user gimprc and added gimprc_set to the PDB.

1999-04-18  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/paintbrush.c: fixed a sensitive setting bug I introduced
	with the last change.

	* app/text_tool.c: added a toggle button which enables calling
	gDynText.

	* app/tool_options.c: the toggle callback does some more sensitive
	settings.

1999-04-18  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/ink.c
	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/transform_tool.c: remember all radio buttons in the
	ToolOptions structures. This enables arbitrary default values and
	gui feedback for the "toggle key" feature.

Sat Apr 17 11:15:35 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool_cmds.c: doh, decipoints not decipixels

Thu Apr 15 23:04:17 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/color_picker.c

	Must account for layer offsets.

Thu Apr 15 14:41:01 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* applied gimp-lecorfec-99041[02]-0, changes follow

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.h (make_color_map):
	replaced free with g_free to fix segfault.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_preview.c (compute_preview):
	allocate xpostab and ypostab only when needed (it could also be
	allocated on stack with a compilation-fixed size like MapObject).
	It avoids to lose some Kb on each preview :)
	Also reindented (unfortunate C-c C-q) some other lines.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c (run):
	release allocated postabs.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c:
	callbacks now have only one argument because gck widget use
	gtk_signal_connect_object. Caused segfault for scale widget.

	* plug-ins/autocrop/autocrop.c (doit):
	return if image has only background (thus fixing a segfault).

	* plug-ins/emboss/emboss.c (pluginCore, emboss_do_preview):
	replaced malloc/free with g_malloc/g_free (unneeded, but
	shouldn't everyone use glib calls ? :)

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c :
	replaced a segfaulting free, and several harmless malloc/free pairs.

	* plug-ins/flame/megawidget.c (mw_preview_build):
	replaced harmless malloc/free pair.
	Note : mwp->bits is malloc'ed but seems to be never freed.

	* plug-ins/fractaltrace/fractaltrace.c (pixels_free):
	replaced a bunch of segfaulting free.
	(pixels_get, dialog_show): replaced gtk_signal_connect_object
	with gtk_signal_connect to accomodate callbacks (caused STRANGE
	dialog behaviour, coz you destroyed buttons one by one).

	* plug-ins/illusion/illusion.c (dialog):
	same gtk_signal_connect_object replacement for same reasons.

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gckcolor.c :
	changed all gck_rgb_to_color* functions to use a static GdkColor
	instead of a malloc'ed area. Provided reentrant functions with
	the old behaviour (gck_rgb_to_color*_r). Made some private functions
	static, too.
	gck_rgb_to_gdkcolor now use the new functions while
	gck_rgb_to_gdkcolor_r is the reentrant version.
	Also affected by this change: gck_gc_set_foreground and
	gck_gc_set_background (no more free(color)).

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gckcolor.h :
	added the gck_rgb_to_gdkcolor_r proto.

	* plug-ins/lic/lic.c (ok_button_clicked, cancel_button_clicked) :
	segfault on gtk_widget_destroy, now calls gtk_main_quit.
	(dialog_destroy) : segfault on window closure when called by
	"destroy" event. Now called by "delete_event".

	* plug-ins/megawidget/megawidget.c (mw_preview_build):
	replaced harmless malloc/free pair.
	Note : mwp->bits is malloc'ed but seems to be never freed.

	* plug-ins/png/png.c (load_image):
	replaced 2 segfaulting free.

	* plug-ins/print/print-ps.c (ps_print):
	replaced a segfaulting free (called many times :).

	* plug-ins/sgi/sgi.c (load_image, save_image):
	replaced a bunch of segfaulting free, and did some harmless
	inits to avoid a few gcc warnings.

	* plug-ins/wind/wind.c (render_wind):
	replaced a segfaulting free.
	(render_blast): replaced harmless malloc/free pair.

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c (ReadImage):
	yet another free()/g_free() problem fixed.

	* plug-ins/exchange/exchange.c (real_exchange):
	ditto.

	* plug-ins/fp/fp.h: added Frames_Check_Button_In_A_Box proto.
	* plug-ins/fp/fp_gtk.c: closing subdialogs via window manager
	wasn't handled, thus leading to errors and crashes.
	Now delete_event signals the dialog control button
	to close a dialog with the good way.

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c (value_pair_create):
	tried to set events mask on scale widget (a NO_WINDOW widget).

	* plug-ins/png/png.c (save_image):
	Replaced 2 free() with g_free() for g_malloc'ed memory.
	Mysteriously I corrected the loading bug but not the saving one :)

Thu Apr 15 14:08:51 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/gdyntext: new plugin

Thu Apr 15 21:20:45 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/color_picker.c

	Added UI feedback to the tool when using the sample average
	option. 
	Fixed the scale of the sample area to be integral (is this right?).

Thu Apr 15 12:14:30 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: fixed an off-by-one error and renamed the tool
	to "Resize & Crop"
	* app/tools.c: reflect the name change 

Thu Apr 15 01:32:58 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: The autocrop mechanism now first checks if there's
	transparency to crop. If there are no transparent borders it
	tries to crop uniformly colored areas from the borders.

Wed Apr 14 14:27:51 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/app_procs.c, app/module_db.[ch]: call module_unload 
	functions on all modules when we quit (don't close it, though).

Wed Apr 14 00:27:53 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* Makefile.am

	Added new pixmap file to Makefile.am EXTRA_DIST

Tue Apr 13 22:17:23 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/bezier_select.c 
	* app/bezier_select.h 
	* app/pathsP.h 
	* app/paths_dialog.c 
	* app/transform_core.c 
	* app/transform_core.h 
	* app/undo.c 	

	New:-

	* pixmap/locked.xpm

	New image. (Your welcome to improve upon it...)

	Paths can now be locked down for transformations. Click next to the
	paths preview and a icon will appear. This path will "locked" during
	transformations (via the transforms tool). Undo for these path 
	transformations is also available.

	Fixed bug when creating a path for the first time when no paths dialog
	visible.	

Tue Apr 13 00:01:24 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped up to 1.1.5

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.in: added GIMP_CHECK_VERSION macro and
	a features #define for 1.1.5

	* app/misc_cmds.c: added a gimp_version PDB function that
	returns the current version (new file)

	* app/internal_procs.c: register gimp_version PDB function

Mon Apr 12 21:54:48 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/boundary.c: code cleanup

	* app/levels.c: applied gimp-lecorfec-990314-0, added spin buttons
	to the levels dialog

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/font-map.scm: changes for updated
	gimp_text interface

Tue Apr 13 02:27:26 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/parasite.[ch]: Removed the parasite load/save functions.
	* app/paraslitelist.[ch]: Same as above, for the list load/save
	functions.

Mon Apr 12 23:44:14 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.c: The "From Selection" functionality is back and works 
	consistently with the "Current Layer only" option. Additionally
	I have used some code from the autocrop plug-in and you can now
	let The GIMP automatically select the crop-area for you. 
	Eventually this need some optimization. For sure the GUI needs to 
	be worked on a bit...

1999-04-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/curves.c
	* app/ellipse_select.c
	* app/eraser.c
	* app/flip_tool.c
	* app/free_select.c
	* app/fuzzy_select.c

	* app/posterize.c
	* app/rect_select.[ch]
	* app/text_tool.c
	* app/threshold.c
	* app/transform_tool.c

	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/toolsF.h: again: all tools :( 

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/tool_options.[ch]
	* app/selection_options.h
	* app/tool_options_ui.h: new files.

	Ok, this time it's general enough for future extensions:

	- The tool options structures are organized like the gtk object
	  system to allow derived tool options.
	- Renamed all create and reset functions to *_options_new() and
	  *_options_reset() to reflect this.
	- Changed tools_register() again. Now it takes just a pointer to a
	  ToolOptions structure.
	- Moved almost the entire tool options gui code to tool_options.c.
	- Visually separated the common selection options from the
	  tool-specific ones. I'd like to do the same with opacity/paint
	  mode in all paint tool options but I think this needs some more
	  discussion.

	* app/histogram_tool.c: changed packing boxes, label alignments.

	* app/paintbrush.c: some more sensitive settings. The gradient
	feature can now be toggled with a button. Hopefully didn't break
	anything.

Sun Apr 11 23:35:31 CEST 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/general.c: save string token length into "token_int".
	Fixed parsing of escape sequences, added '\0' and '"' sequences.

	* app/gimprc.c: implement new type "parasite".

	* app/gimpparasite.c: load and save parasiterc in "semi-ascii".

	* libgimp/parasite.[ch]: new function parasite_flags.

Sat Apr 10 23:33:26 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_picker.c: added a sample average feature (requested
	by Xach) that picks a color from the average of all the pixels
	from the source point within a given radius

1999-04-11  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pixmaps/delete.xpm: I put the delete icon from gnome here,
	IMHO it looks nice.

Sat Apr 10 14:43:24 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool_cmds.c: doh, XLFD stuff is in decipoints

	* app/color_cmds.h: removed

	* app/color_cmds.c: pdbgened file now

	* app/lut_funcs.h: export ChannelLutType enum

	* app/internal_procs.c: register pdbgened color procs

	* app/menus.c: reverted keyboard underlines since they need more
	discussion

Sat Apr 10 15:48:46 BST 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c: Velocity-sensitivity added to ink tool.

Fri Apr  9 21:45:10 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool_cmds.c: new file (from pdbgen)

	* app/Makefile.am: add new file, use AM_CPPFLAGS instead of CPPFLAGS

	* app/internal_procs.c: register pdbgened text_tool procs

	* app/text_tool.c: remove PDB stuff, export text_render and
	text_get_extents and SizeType and SUPERSAMPLE symbols

	* app/text_tool.c: remove PDB stuff

	* app/blend.[ch]
	* app/bucket_fill.[ch]
	* app/clone.[ch]
	* app/convolve.[ch]: export some enums

	* app/channel.h
	* app/paint_core.h: #define->enum

	* app/channel.c
	* app/gimpparasite.c
	* app/parasitelist.c
	* app/pixel_processor.c: warning cleanup

	* app/convert_cmds.c
	* app/paths_cmds.c: slight pdbgen changes

1999-04-09  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimphistogramF.h: new file containing typedef for
 	GimpHistogram.

	* app/gimphistogram.h: moved GimpHistogram typedef to
 	gimphistogramF.h

	* app/lut_funcs.h: include gimphistogramF.h again now that the
 	file actually exists.

Fri Apr  9 18:58:41 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/lut_funcs.h: changed the include to "gimphistogram.h" rather
	tha "gimphistogramF.h". I could have split the typedef struct
	_GimpHistogram GimpHistogram into a newly created gimphistogramF.h
	file as some modules seem to do, but chose this because it seemed
	like a less drastic fix.

1999-04-08  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/Makefile.am: build color_cmds, lut_funcs, and pixel_processor
	* app/app_procs.c: feedback in the splash screen when loading
 	parasites.
	* app/boundary.c: Optimized find_empty_segs.
	
	* app/brightness_contrast.[ch]
	* app/levels.[ch]
	* app/posterize.[ch]:
 	moved pdb and lut calculation code.  These files now contain only 
	GUI functions.

	* app/channel.c: Optimized channel_bounds (fewer compares, better
 	use of registers).  Use color_region instead of channel_*_segment
 	in channel_combine_rect.  Optimized channel_combine_ellipse by
 	skipping pixels inside of the ellipse.  Use
 	pixel_region_process_parallel in channel_combine_mask.  Use a
 	GimpLut in channel_invert, and channel_sharpen.

	* app/invert.c
	* app/equalize.c: moved the lut functions to lut_funcs.c
	
	* app/gimpdrawable.c, app/gimpdrawableP.h
	* app/gimpimage.c, app/gimpimageP.h: removed unused gimpmatrix 
	variables/includes.
	
	* app/gimplut.[ch]: added new function gimp_lut_process_inline
 	that operates on a single PixelRegion.

Fri Apr  9 01:52:23 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/autocrop/autocrop.c: Fixed a Bad Bug(TM).

1999-04-08  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/airbrush.c
	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/clone.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/convolve.c
	* app/crop.[ch]

	* app/text_tool.[ch]
	* app/threshold.c
	* app/transform_tool.c

	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/toolsF.h: in other words: all tools

	Implemented the "reset tool options" feature.
	- All tools register with a title string and a reset function now.
	- The tool options' variables have two related <var>_d (default)
	  and <var>_w (widget) variables to restore the default values.

	"Standardized" the tool options UI:
	- Put the stuff info a frame to give a hint that the dialog's
	  contents will change. 
	- table layout, sensitive setting, spacings, borders, ...
	
	As I had them all in my emacs simultaneously, I couldn't resist to
	standardize the tools' *.c files declaration parts ;) Ansi stuff.

Thu Apr  8 21:19:05 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/image_map.c
	
	Fixed boundary problem in new function image_map_get_color_at().

Thu Apr  8 07:12:10 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/crop.[ch]: Ok, this is a little bit more than what we 
	discussed on the list: Basically, it allows to use the crop 
	tool as usual or as a resize-tool for layers and the image.
	
	The defaults are the new behaviour. Holding the <Alt>-Key
	when creating the selection toggles the "Allow-expand" mode,
	holding the <Shift>-key when cropping, gives you the opposite
	of your default setting for "Crop layers".

	The button for "Selection" is gone, but will reappear somewhere
	else soon. But first, I need some sleep...
	
Wed Apr  7 23:53:22 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/curves.c
	
	Just noticed a bug that has been around for ages. The preview

	mode is selected. Fixed it. 

Wed Apr  7 22:44:02 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/curves.c
	* app/image_map.c
	* app/image_map.h

	Curves dialog now has "interactive feedback". Press and drag the 
	mouse button in the image window and a marker will appear in the
	curves dialog showing the channel value at that point.
	
Wed Apr  7 00:50:13 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.c: when using fixed_size selections create the
	selection into the direction the user moved the mouse

1999-04-06  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/rect_select.h: oops, didn't commit this one.

	will be treated as 0% and 100%.

	* app/crop.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c: enable "percent".

	* app/rect_select.c fixed size selections can be made in units and
	percent now, table layout, label adjustment.

Mon Apr  5 23:24:30 BST 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	                          along the curve & the normal at the point).
	  gimp_path_get_tattoo 
	  gimp_get_path_by_tattoo


       	Paths now have tattoos (similar to the layer and image tattoos).

	* app/move.c 
	* app/scroll.c 

	Try to fix the problem where mouse events from the rulers get
	mixed up with those from the canvas causing guides & image dragging
	to "jump" around when the mouse enters the ruler areas.

Mon Apr  5 23:59:37 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/color_balance.c: Color-balance didn't work when used
	from a script because the LUTs weren't set. This is fixed now 
	and SOTA-Chrome works again.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am

	* app/paintbrush.c:  Skip //  comments.
	* app/paint_core.c : Use /* */ intead of //.  IRIX ver. fails

1999-04-03  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/shear_tool.c: forgot this file. Should compile again now,
	sorry :(

1999-04-02  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gimage_mask.[ch]: made function headers ansi compliant.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: minor GUI and signal handling
	changes. Added a WM hint pixmap to the prefs dialog but commented
	it out because it looked ugly. If someone has a nice pixmap,
	please try it and tell me ;)

	* app/color_picker.c
	* app/crop.c
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/perspective_tool.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/info_dialog.[ch]: the info_dialog allows scales, spinbuttons

	* app/fileops.c: Thumbnails save with checkerboard-alpha.
	Saved thumbnail comments include the file size.

Tue Mar 30 20:50:21 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c:
	3.00.01 - Round image timing to nearest 10ms instead of
	truncating.  Insert a mandatory 10ms minimum delay
	for the frames of looping animated GIFs, to avoid
	generating an evil CPU-sucking animation that 'other'
	GIF-animators sometimes like to save.

Mon Mar 29 19:05:03 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.4 release

Mon Mar 29 23:39:49 BST 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: Squeezed out a little more fun.

	* plug-ins/gap/README: doh, forgot to commit that one yesterday

1999-03-29  Pavel Machek  <pavel@artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* app/menus.c (toolbox_entries): underline letters so keyboard is
	bit more usable

Sun Mar 28 14:03:59 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sharpen/sharpen.c (rgba_filter, gray_filter,
	graya_filter): fixed a stupid bug causing sharpen to fail in the
	cases other than plain rgb.

Sun Mar 28 23:56:46 MEST 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap/README: reflect the fact that GAP is now part of
	the distribution
	* plug-ins/gap/gimp_1.0.2: removed since the files were duplicates
	* plug-ins/gap/*.c: use g_getenv, g_malloc, g_new and g_free 

Sat Mar 27 22:37:35 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/procedural_db.h: #include <glib.h>

	* app/paintbrush.[ch]: added the ability to select the 
	gradient repeat mode from the gui. Made the gradient
	length slider hopefully a bit more useful (ie, a
	more useful range)


1999-03-27  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/brush_select.c
	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/color_select.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/palette_select.c
	* app/pattern_select.c: applied a patch from Marco Lamberto
	<lm@geocities.com> which unifies actionareas ("Cancel" rightmost
	and default). Did the same in some more dialogs.

	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.c
	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.[ch]: completely reworked the preferences
	dialog:

	- select the notebook's pages with a tree.
	- reordered the categories. Please give me feedback, this really
	  needs to be intuitive.
	- removed lots of unused #include's.
	- turned the prefs. dialog into a test site for new convenience
	  constructors. These changes are however not visible. Flame me
	  until they're perfect ;) When finished, this stuff can save
	  *many* lines of gtk+ code.

	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c: made it circular.

1999-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	g_return_if_fail()

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c: memory leak & compiler warning

	* configure.in
	* gimprc.in
	* user_install
	* user_install.bat
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/*: added the FractalExplorer plugin.

	* app/install.c: ditto and made the install help text more
	editable by moving it to an array.

Thu Mar 25 22:44:36 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Ok. I'll add the file this time..

Thu Mar 25 22:40:36 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	The paths .pdb stub for Yosh to look at.

1999-03-25  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_funcs.[ch]: Added an edge_lock parameter to
 	thin_region.  Split the radius parameter into xradius and yradius
 	in thin_region and fatten_region.

	* app/channel.c: fixed a bug in channel_bounds that I introduced
 	last time I tried to fix a bug in channel_bounds.  Minor
 	modifications to work with the improved thin/fatten region
 	functions.

Wed Mar 24 11:05:38 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: use AC_PATH_PROGS to find perl.

Tue Mar 23 12:59:20 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile
	* plug-ins/xjt: added xjt plug-in created by Wolfgang Hofer.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/gap/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/gap/.../Makefile.am (all subdirs)
	Cleaned up the mess I left when adding the gap plug-in. Sorry!

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_filter_foreach.c: Use g_getenv, g_malloc 
	and g_free.

Sun Mar 21 23:11:31 EST 1999  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/paintbrush.c: oops, forgot to make fade work
	again after the gradient stuff. Fixed.

Mon Mar 22 00:38:20 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-
	* Makefile.am

	* paths_dialog.h
	* xcf.c

	New:-
	* paths_cmds.c
	* paths_cmds.h

	PDB functions for paths. (More to follow).
	Functions are:-
		gimp_path_list
		gimp_path_get_points
		gimp_path_get_current
		gimp_path_set_current
		gimp_path_set_points
		gimp_path_stroke_current	
	
Sun Mar 21 15:29:38 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c app/edit_selection.c app/move.c:
	Happy-fun opaque layer moves.

	* app/edit_selection.c: I doubt that using button3 to abort
	a layer move has worked for a long time.  I rewrote some
	stuff and moved the 'abort' button to button2.  Hold it down
	when you release button1, to abort the current move.  It
	doesn't actually abort, it just automatically does an undo.

Sat Mar 20 22:51:51 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* fileops.c: The file revert operation clears the undo stack
	upon a revert to get rid of the actions caused by the open
	operation.

Sat Mar 20 21:55:53 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* disp_callbacks.c: Reduce some possibly-redundant re-renders
	on expose.

	* acinclude.m4
	* config.guess
	* config.sub
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: upgrade to libtool 1.2f

	* autogen.sh: libtool is not required to autogen gimp

Fri Mar 19 04:01:04 EST 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>
	
	* plug-ins/mail/mail.c: added a from: field, made
	it check gimprc for a gump-from field (per request
	by tigert). fixed it so it would actually use
	the last vals properly.

	* plug-ins/gap/Makefile.am: removed the SUBDIRS line
	so it at least builds. Probabaly not the right fix,
	but while I'm committing...

1999-03-18  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/ops_buttons.h: removed a c++ style comment

	* app/paint_funcs.c: applied Craig Wiegert's patch to fix
 	the rounding errors in the scaling code.
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: Use a mutex lock in disolve pixels instead of
 	rand_r on linux systems since linux's rand_r appears to be broken.

	* app/bezier_select.c: applied Shuji Narazaki's patch that corrects
 	for layer offsets in bezier_stroke.

Thu Mar 18 19:35:48 EST 1999  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/paintbrush.c
	* app/paint_core.c
	* app/paint_core.h: moved all the code for figuring out the

	paintbrush.c to use the new function. Also now can either loop
	thorugh the gradient (sawtooth, start->end, start->end or 
	triangle start->end,end->start). Also mode for going
	thought the gradient once, forwards or backwards. None of these
	options are available from the gui or the PDB yet though.

Thu Mar 18 02:12:26 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/gap/* (new files)
	Added the GAP (GIMP Animation Plugin) created by Wolfgang
	Hofer. Eventually we'll think about making this a 
	seperate package, but now it's here for testing and your
	pleasure.

1999-03-18  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* configure.in plug-ins/Makefile.am: Add wmf plug-in.

	* plug-ins/wmf: New subdirectory. Wmf plug-in finally works OK
	on X11 now, with a workaround for a GDK bug.

Wed Mar 17 21:46:08 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-ins/exchange/exchange.c: fixed NON_INTERACTIVE
	and RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS modes

Tue Mar 16 23:39:26 EST 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/paintbrush.c: paintbrush_motion, added the ability

	 gimp_paintbrush_extended_gradient to the PDB

Tue Mar 16 19:12:08 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/batch.c: make the perl-server independent of script-fu. This
	also speeds up starup considerably.

1999-03-16  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/gdisplay.h: double the length of the cursor_format_str as
	users may define strange units now

	* app/xcf.c: forgot a sanity check when loading/saving the user
	unit property

	* user_install
	* user_install.bat
	* unitrc: new file (default unit database) and some documentation

	image's unit 

	* app/install.c: mention unitrc installation

	* app/internal_procs.c: install unit procedures

	* app/xcf.c: new xcf property for user defined units. An image's
	unit is saved as either an integer ID (built in units) or as
	a full unit definition without any ID

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: moved gimpunit.o from libgimpi.a to
	libgimp.a

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: get/set an image's unit with PDB calls

	* libgimp/gimpunit.h: this file is now the header for both
	app/gimpunit.c and libgimp/gimpunit.c

	* libgimp/gimpunit.c: does the unit calls as PDB calls now

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]: enable user unit functionality and a
	unit selection dialog

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: disble hilighting on focus_in_event and
	minor bugfixes

	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c: set image unit to "mm" if tiff unit is
	"cm", save "cm" if image unit is metric

Mon Mar 15 14:40:29 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sharpen/sharpen.c: Fixed the algorithm so that it
	doesn't make the image lighter for high sharpness values. Also,
	increased the accuracy of the algorithm so that it won't degrade
	the bit depth.

Mon Mar 15 01:34:08 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/ops_buttons.[c|h]: implemented a way to catch the 
	modifier key that was pressed when the button was clicked

	* app/[layers|channels|paths]_dialog.c: changed the ops_button
	arrays to reflect the changes described above and implemented
	a few power-user features in the dialogs:
	( Shift->Layer Up / Layer Down  moves to top/bottom
	  Shift->Channel To Selection   adds the channel to the sel
	  Ctrl->Channel To Selectio     subtracts from the selection ) 

1999-03-14  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* gimprc.in: removed two unused directories from plug-in-path.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c: make the first spinbutton grab the focus
	and one more unit initialisation bugfix

	* app/interface.c: grab focus in query_[string|int|..]_box()
	This still needs to be done in many dialogs to be consistent.

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: made the module-path configurable

	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.[ch]: change the order of the buttons to
	match the order in the L&C dialog

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: enabled highlighting of the
	spinbuttons' contents on focus_in_event.
	Ugly new function gimp_size_entry_grab_focus() because it seems
	impossible to implement gtk_widget_grab_focus(sizeentry). 

Sun Mar 14 17:56:14 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: correctly set the status of the
	chain_button in the monitors section when creating the dialog

Sun Mar 14 13:26:11 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: reverted Michaels change as it is defintely
	wrong. The current behaviour is probably not perfect and I'll try
	to fix that.

1999-03-14  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/xcf.c:

	Improved the rle compression routine.  It compresses
 	photographic images ~8% better and is fully backwards compatible.
	
  	Modified the tile load/save routines to buffer their data and
 	only make one read/write call per tile.  This results in a 3-4X
 	improvement in load and save times.

	Modified the path load/save routines to work properly when gint is
 	not a 32 bit type.

	* app/pathsP.h: Changed the types of some struct data members
	to be consistant with what is saved in the xcf files.

1999-03-14  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.c: checked in a buggy version before ;)

1999-03-14  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/app_procs.c: only save sessionrc if the corresponding
	preferences option is enabled

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: preferences renovation part I: the
	directories page uses the new widgets from libgimp

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* ligbimp/gimpi.def
	* libgimp/gimpfileselection.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppatheditor.[ch]: new widgets which enable a more
	comfortable file and searchpath selection

	* Makefile.am
	* pixmaps/no.xpm
	* pixmaps/yes.xpm: pixmaps used by the new widgets

Sat Mar 13 19:46:54 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* pixmaps/ptoselection.xpm -> pixmaps/toselection.xpm
	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c: Provide a button to convert a channel
	into a selection. Share the xpm with the paths-dialog. Add two new
	menu entries that allow to add or subtract the channel to/from the 
	current selection (as suggested by Wolfgang Hofer). 

1999-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	Moved all pixmaps and bitmaps from app/ and libgimp/ to pixmaps/

	* app/tools/*
	* libgimp/chain.xpm: removed these files

	* pixmaps/*.[xpm|xbm]: new directory containing all pixmaps

	* app/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* Makefile.am: changed list of EXTRA_DIST files accordingly

	* app/channels_dialog.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c
	* app/palette.c
	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.c: adjusted some #include's

Fri Mar 12 21:30:57 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@gimp.org>

	Changed:-

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c

	Some code cleanups and bug fixes. Fixed problem with "copy" path
	producing very long names. 

	Added functionality to import/export paths to files. (It was 
	there before!)

	Also added some new bezier_stroke code that Shuji Narazaki posted
	to the gimp-devel list.

	* plug-ins/plugindetails/plugindetails.c

	Removed unwanted <regex.h>. 
	Thanks to Tan Koan-Sin <freedom@csie.nctu.edu.tw> for pointing 
	this out.

Fri Mar 12 22:15:49 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimp.c: split gimp_quit into two functions, gimp_quit
	and gimp_close. Let gimp_main return to the calling function in
	the common cases (i.e. not in the error case).

1999-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: correct resolution size_entry
	initialisation.

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.c: fixed the update bug reported by Marc.
	Works now but still needs discussion...

1999-03-11  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: made the INT_MULT3 macro be more accurate.

1999-03-12  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	This is mostly unit stuff and code cleanup
	
	* libgimp/gimpi.def: add some functions

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: new function
	gimp_size_entry_set_refval_digits() which allows for float pixel
	input. SIGFPE bugfix from Yasuhiro Shirasaki
	<yasuhiro@awa.tohoku.ac.jp>, minor bugfixes.

	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]: add a separator after "pixels",
	bugfixes.

	* app/interface.[ch]: split up the old query_string_box() into
	query_[string|int|float|size]_box(). All functions take an
	optional GtkObject* parameter and connect to that object's
	"destroy" signal, this fixes some segfaults. And a global
	s/container_border_width/container_set_border_width/

	* app/commands.s: grow, shrink, border, feather now use the
	query_size_box. Used MIN(xres,yres) for now for the pixel<->unit
	calculations. Fixed some memory leaks.

	* app/global_edit.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/paths_dialog.c: changed the query_string_box() calls

Thu Mar 11 19:42:12 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in, config.h.in: added test for _exit (mirrors the
	change in plug-ins/perl/etc/configure.frag)

1999-03-10  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* plug-ins/wind/wind.c, plug-ins/bumpmap/bumpmap.c: Set
 	appropriate values for the tile cache.  This makes a large speed
 	difference.

1999-03-10  Michael Natterer  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* app/devices.c: don't let session management set the size of the
	"Device Status" dialog, as the number of devices may change
	between sessions

Mon Mar  8 16:45:06 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.3 release

	* gimprc.5.in: use @GIMP_VERSION@

Mon Mar  8 16:27:25 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/hue_saturation.c: comment out Raph's saturation changes,
	didn't work in all cases

1999-03-08  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/devices.c (devices_write_rc): A line had been deleted by
 	mistake.

	* app/frac.c: Removed some CRs.

	* app/install.c (install_run): Typo.

	* modules/module.def: New file.

	* Makefile.am app/Makefile.am libgimp/Makefile.am
 	modules/Makefile.am: Added Win32 implementation files to
 	distributed file set.

Mon Mar  8 21:23:10 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/layer_cmds.c: updated gimp_layer_new and gimp_layer_set_mode to
	accept a DIVIDE_MODE argument.

1999-03-08  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/plug_in.c: use g_io_channel_close/unref pairs instead of close
	in plug_in_open().

1999-03-07  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	Second batch of Win32 merging. This time also some Unix code is
	affected, but the semantics should stay the same. Plug-in
	communication now uses GIOChannels, not plain file descriptors
	(this change only affects a few files).
	
	* README.win32,config.h.win32,gimprc.win32,user_install.bat: New files.
	
	* libgimp/gimpenv.[ch]: New files. gimpenv contains functions that
	handle directory and file names specific to the GIMP installation
	and runtime environment.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: Include gimpenv.h. Declare variables with
	__declspec on Win32. MAIN() defines also WinMain() on Win32.
	gimp_gtkrc() declaration moved to gimpenv.h.
	
	* libgimp/{gimp.c,gimpmenu.c,gimpprotocol.[ch],
	gimptile.c,gimpwire.[ch]}: Use GIOChannels instead of file
	descriptors.

	* libgimp/gimp.c: (gimp_extension_process): Calculate microsecond
	value in timeval correctly from millisecond parameter.
	
	* libgimp/{gimpmatrix.c,gserialize.c}: Include <string.h>.

	* libgimp/gimpmenu.c: (gimp_setup_callbacks): Call
	gimp_request_wakeups().

	* libgimp/gimpmodule.h: Don't declare module_init and
	module_unload when compiling the module itself, because of clashes
	with the G_MODULE_EXPORT.

	* libgimp/gimpwire.c: Use g_warning instead of g_print. No
	terminating newlines necessary in g_error calls.
	
	* libgimp/Makefile.am: Add gimpenv.[ch].
	(CPPFLAGS): Define DATADIR.

	* libgimp/{makefile.msc,gimpfeatures.h.win32,gimp.def,
	gimpi.def,gimpui.def}: New files.
	
	* modules/Makefile.am (CPPFLAGS): Define MODULE_COMPILATION.

	* modules/makefile.msc: New file.

	* app/{about_dialog.c,app_procs.c,gimprc.c,install.c,
	tips_dialog.c}: Use gimp_data_directory() instead of DATADIR.

	* app/app_procs.c (app_init): Use gimp_gtkrc() and g_get_tmp_dir().

	* app/batch.c: Need <io.h> with MSC. (batch_init): Fix brace bug.

	* app/{color_notebook.c,docindexif.c,ink.c}: Include <string.h>.

	* app/{devices.c,docindex.c,gimprc.c,menus.c,plug_in.c,session.c}:
	Use gimp_personal_rc_file().

	* app/docindexif.h: IDEAPATH unneeded.

	* app/errors.c: Use g_error() on Win32, at least. Don't use
	g_on_error_query() on Win32.

	* app/general.c (get_token): Handle \r, \n and \z (control-Z).

	* app/gimprc.c (open_backup_file): Redone. Now you can pass in the
	name of a secondary file to use if the primary one doesn't exist.

	* app/gimprc.[ch]: gimp_directory() removed, is now in
	libgimp/gimpenv.[ch].

	* app/install.c (install_run): Add Win32 code. We cannot use popen
	as in Unix, because the Microsoft runtime library's _popen doesn't
	work in GUI applications. So just run the bat file in a console
	window and let the user spot any errors...

	* app/interface.c: Include dialog_handler.h.

	* app/layer.c: Include libgimp/parasite.h.

	* app/plug_in.c: No terminating newline necessary in g_message()
	calls.

	* app/{plug_in.c,session.c}: Open settings files that *are* text
	in text mode, not binary.
	
	* app/plug_in.c: Add Win32 code. (plug_in_write_rc_string): Escape
	problematic characters (\r, \n and control-Z). Use
	plug_in_write_rc_string() to write program name, too (contains
	backslashes on Win32...). Use GIOChannels.

	* app/text_tool.c: Shouldn't use gdk_colormap_alloc_color() to
	allocate black and white on Win32 after all.

	* app/tile_swap.c: Include <stdio.h>

	* app/{gimp.def,gimp.rc,makefile.msc,wilber.ico}: New
	files. Thanks to Paolo Bonzini for the Wilber icon.

	* app/Makefile.am (CPPFLAGS): GIMPDIR or DATADIR not needed,
	handled by libgimp/gimpenv.c functions.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/{alien-glow-button,beveled-button,
	beveled-pattern-button,beveled-pattern-heading,gimp-headers,
	gimp-labels,hsv-graph,i26-gunya2,image-structure,pupi-button,
	,title-header}.scm: Use the gimp-text*-fontname forms
	calls. Register having corresponding SF-FONT parameters. Thanks to
	Piet van Oostrum for this.

1999-03-07  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/brush_select.c: pop up the brush-edit dialog whenever the
 	user creates a new brush.

Sat Mar  6 03:04:31 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: correctly initialize the zoom indicator
	in the title and the statusbar

Fri Mar  5 21:45:39 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	This is a bit of a biggy. Added paths to layers & channels 
	dialog. This is not complete yet (it still has some rough edges ;-)

	New:-

	* paths_dialog.c
	* paths_dialog.h
	* pathsP.h

	These are the core parts of the paths dialog & interaction.

	* tools/penadd.xpm 
	* tools/pendel.xpm 
	* tools/pennorm.xpm
	* tools/penedit.xpm
	* tools/penstroke.xpm

	New images found in the dialog. Maybe someone with a better
	artistic flair could replace these?

	Changed:-

	* Makefile.am

	Added new files for build

	* layers_dialog.c
	
	Added new tab for paths.

	* bezier_select.h
	* bezier_selectP.h
	* bezier_select.c

	Rearrangement & fixes. Not finished yet.

	* iscissors.c

	Header file changes. (Need to include more headers).

	* gdisplay.c
	* gdisplay.h

	Hmmm... Added a function that did a mapping from gimage to gdisp.
	This is a little bit of a "hack", but it was needed.. really.

	* ops_buttons.h
	* ops_buttons.c

	Enhanced to create more types of button ops. Used in the paths dialog.

	* channels_dialog.c

	Header file changes?

	* xcf.c

	Paths stored in new PROP. Yosh.. I did as you and Adam suggested. 

	* gimpimage.c
	* gimpimage.h
	* gimpimageP.h

	Added paths items to the image structures.


1999-03-04  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* app/gimprc.c: Added a g_strdup() on DEFAULT_IMAGE_TITLE_FORMAT,
	otherwise it would try to free a constant string when cancling out of
	prefs or changing the title-style.

Wed Mar  3 18:38:31 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	More unit/resolution stuff (most of it from Michael).
	
	* app/gimpimage.c: use defaults from gimprc

	* app/gdisplay.c: a new format_string for coordinates

	* blend.c
	* crop.c
	* edit_selection.c
	* rect_select.c: use the new format when displaying sizes
	in the statusbar

	* file_new_dialog.c: cleaned up the advanced/simple cases

Wed Mar  3 17:59:09 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.5.in
	* gimprc.in
	* libgimp/gimpunit.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.c : Seems that Michael had created some
	more patches I didn't knew of.
	This commit now should bring it all uptodate. 

Wed Mar  3 15:39:01 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.[ch]: that looks much better now

Wed Mar  3 13:24:00 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.5.in
	* gimprc.in
	* libgimp/gimpunit.c
	* libgimp/gimpunit.h
	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Hopefully synced the work on 
	real-world-units by applying (most of) the patches Michael
	Natterer has provided. Fixed a few minor and cosmetic bugs 
	in those patches.

Tue Mar  2 01:24:41 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/chain.xpm
	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.c
	* libgimp/gimpchainbutton.h: a mockup for a new widget that 
	indicates that two entries are connected. Please feel free to
	hack this as I'm afraid I won't find the time to finish this.

	* app/file_new_dialogs: a first attempt to make the dialog 
	easier to use w/o loosing the flexibility it provided.

1999-02-28  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/Makefile.am: added gimphistogram*, histogramwidget*, 
	removed histogram.[ch]

	* app/histogram.[ch]: removed.  replaced with histogramwidget.[ch].

	* app/{gimphistogramP.h, gimphistogram.h, gimphistogram.c}: new
 	functions that calculate histograms in parallel and perform
 	calculations on them.
	
	* app/histogramwidget.[ch]: Same as old histogram.[ch], only it is
 	now a real widget, and it uses GimpHistograms instead of arrays of
 	values.

	* app/curves.c: #include gimphistogram.h instead of histogram.h.
	
	* app/equalize.c: use GimpHistogram and GimpLut.
	
	* app/gimpbrush.c, app/gimpimage.c, app/gimpset.c: use 
	GTK_RUN_FIRST in calls to gimp_signal_new.

	* app/histogram_tool.c, app/levels.c, app/threshold.c: modified to
 	use the new HistogramWidget.

	* app/paint_funcs.c: removed some unused variables.
	
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: only display the num-processor field
 	if we are configured --with-mp
	
	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: removed a couple of c++ style comments.
	
Sun Feb 28 23:48:17 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: loosened check for perl version, perl5.004 is now
 	supposed to work with gimp-perl.

Sat Feb 27 23:25:55 EST 1999 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/xach-effect.scm: removed
	some old dead code that was keeping it from working. 
	Now xach's name is untarnished again.

Sat Feb 27 18:07:53 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/scale.c: use image's units, not the ruler units, when
	    dimentioning the rulers.  Gimprc ruler-units syntax has no
	    use anymore.

	* app/gdisplay.[ch]: applied statusbar unit display patch from
 	    Michael Natterer.

Sat Feb 27 16:54:51 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: When a gimage's colourmap is changed,
	implicitly queue an update of the whole gimage.

	* plug-ins/vinvert/vinvert.c: Speed up - iterate over
	regions, not rows.

	* plug-ins/autostretch_hsv/autostretch_hsv.
	* plug-ins/c_astretch/c_astretch.c
	* plug-ins/normalize/normalize.c
	* plug-ins/vinvert/vinvert.c:
	Remove the explicit (and actually incorrect) update when
	changing a gimage's colourmap.

Fri Feb 26 21:19:10 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: 
	Many revisions to the box-cut quantizer used in RGB->INDEXED
	conversion.  Box to be cut is chosen on the basis of posessing an
	axis with the largest sum of weighted perceptible error, rather
	than based on volume or population.  The box is split along this
	axis rather than its longest axis, at the point of error mean
	rather than simply at its centre.  Error-limiting in the F-S
	dither has been disabled - it may become optional again later.  If
	you're convinced that you have an image where the old dither looks
	better, let me know.

Thu Feb 25 11:40:36 1999  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/hue_saturation.c (hue_saturation_calculate_transfers):
	Made increasing the saturation more subtle - which is what
	you want for enhancing the color in photos.

Thu Feb 25 12:19:50 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file_new_dialog.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: make use of the new GimpSizeEntry
	widget (patch provided by Michael Natterer). 
	I'm not yet content with the way two entries are glued together
	by "Force equal ...", but I'm working on it.

Thu Feb 25 02:21:52 CST 1999 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: special case Close/Quit in <Image>/File
	  to always be at the bottom of the menu.

Wed Feb 24 19:19:07 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: applied the patch Michael Natterer
	sent me. This makes the gimpsizeentry much more flexible.

Tue Feb 23 02:57:16 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/drawable_cmds.c: fix documentation for
	drawable_type_with_alpha.

Tue Feb 23 00:05:39 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in.c
	app/plug_in.h: Moved the RunModeType enum
	into the header so we can use it elsewhere (e.g. fileops)

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c
	plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: Don't show progress-bars if we're
	running noninteractively.  This makes thumbnail updating
	look more pleasant.  Try to do the same for all file plugins
	(and others)!

	* app/fileops.c: Reworked the thumbnail display again, fixed
	some buglets, file_open_image() is RunMode aware, added some
	tweaks, rhubarb rhubarb, merged in some 'cosmetic' tweaks
	from Marco.

Mon Feb 22 14:08:59 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/procedural_db.h, app/internal_procs.c, app/procedural_db.c
	libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.in: "gimp_procedural_db_get_data_size"
	exists, but has never been registered (of course it was buggy as
	well). This is especially funny since the function in _gimp-perl_
	that should be using it since half a year tested the wrong symbol
	for its presence, so this went undetected. One could argue that
	this is the least used gimp function ever ;->

1999-02-22 adam, blah blah

	* app/appenv.h: fixed a macro bug waiting to happen

	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: some crappy tweaks

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: debugging turned off

1999-02-22  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/channel.c: fixed bug in channel_bounds

Sun Feb 21 22:37:56 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpentry.[ch]: removed
	* libgimp/gimpsizeentry.[ch]: new files
	Moved the gimpentry stuff to gimpsizeentry and changed it to use
	the new gimpunit functionality.

Sun Feb 21 20:43:00 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpunitmenu.[ch]: new files
	Added the gimpunitmenu-widget Michael Natterer contributed.
	Now lets see how this integrates with the gimpentry-widget...

Sat Feb 20 16:12:33 CST 1999 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/tips_dialog.c: Add default to Cancel button, remove
	  unset GTK_RECEIVES_DEFAULT from prev/next buttons (they
	  are like toolbar buttons), changed abreviated prev to
	  previous, prev/next button are now same size, cancel button
	  is in a button box.  Added vboxes where necessary to prevent
	  prev/next and check button from filling vertically.

	* app/app_procs.c: when splashscreen dialog is larger than the 
	  logo, (due to huge font), center logo.

	* app/file_new_dialog.c: patch from Marco Lamb <lm@geocities.com>
	  disallows resizing, changes vertical expanding of widgets to 
	  not occur

	* app/palette.c: patch from Marco Lamb <lm@geocities.com>.  Makes
	  +/- buttons for zoom pixmaps (eventually, these can be replaced
	  with a magnifying glass with a little +/- I think), so that they
	  no longer expand as they did before.  I modified his patch so it
	  did not create a misused toolbar.  I did some other stuff here too,
	  moved Close button to the left, made it the window's default,
	  and unset GTK_RECEIVES_DEFAULT off of the non-bottom buttons.

	* app/actionarea.c: another patch from Marco Lamb <lm@geocities.com>.
	  This one changes buttons to be put in a button box which is right
	  justified.  If we decide later that spread is better, we can 
	  change this easy enough.

	* app/tools/zoom_in.xpm, app/tools/zoom_out.xpm: + and - graphics.

	* libgimp/gimpunit.h
	  libgimp/gimpunit.c: New files from Michael Natterer 
	  <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>, gimp_unit_* routines.

	* app/gimage.h
	  app/gimpimage.h
	  app/gimpimage.c
	  app/gimpimageP.h
	  app/xcf.c: Patches from Michael Natterer <mitschel@cs.tu-berlin.de>,
	  which keep a unit assocated with an image. 

1999-02-21  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	First batch of changes to merge the Win32 version. This will be
	done in pieces, don't expect to be able to compile on Win32 from
	these sources yet.  And of course, the official version of GTk+
	doesn't include the Win32 stuff yet.
 	
	* configure.in acconfig.h: Check for <sys/param.h> and
	<sys/times.h>. Check for rint().

	* app/appenv.h: There shouldn't be any need to include
	<gdk/gdkx.h>. GDK hides the windowing system. Thus we cannot use
	GDK_DISPLAY either, and the DISPLAY macro must go.
	
	* app/*.c: Guard inclusion of Unix-only headers. Include config.h
	(as first header) where needed. Use G_DIR_SEPARATOR(_S) and
	G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR(_S) where appropriate.

	* app/app_procs.c: Unreference fonts after use.

	* app/asupsample.c: Include <stdlib.h> for size_t.

	* app/batch.c (batch_init): No batch mode from stdin on Win32.

	* app/blob.c app/gimpbrushgenerated.c: Define M_PI if needed.

	* app/clone.c app/disp_callbacks.c app/rotate_tool.c
	app/scale_tool.c: Use GDK constants instead of Xlib ones (with
	identical value).

	* app/color_area.c app/color_select.c app/gdisplay.c
	app/parasitelist.c app/preferences_dialog.c app/tile_manager.c:
	Include <string.h> as we use functions from there.

	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c (ipal_draw_cell): Watch out for
	allocation width and height calues that are in fact
	negative. (This can happen at least on Win32 for some reason.)

	* app/datafiles.c: Define S_IS* macros for MSC.

	* app/docindex.c: Reorder header files. Otherwise guint32
	isn't available for gimpimageF.h, for instance.

	* app/docindexif.h: No need to incude <gdk/gdkprivate.h>.

	* app/errorconsole.c: Define S_I[RW]USR for MSC.

	* app/general.c: Define S_ISREG for MSC.

	* app/fileops.c: Include <process.h> and <direct.h> for MSC.

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c app/paint_funcs.c app/posterize.c:
	Define rint() using floor if necessary.

	* app/gimpbrushgenerated.c: Use unsigned char for lookup table.

	* app/gimpdrawable.c: Use <string.h>, not <strings.h>.

	* app/main.c: Conditionalize on signal names.

	* app/module_db.c: Include <time.h> for time_t. Handle Win32 DLL
	names.

	* app/palette.c (palette_create_entries): If no HOME, ignore ~.

	* app/procedural_db.c app/tips_dialog.c: No need to open text
	files in binary mode.

	* app/temp_buf.c: Include <process.h> for MSC.

	* app/text_tool.c: Use GDK to get black and white pixel values. 

1999-02-19  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c (save_dialog): Changed the plugin dialog 
	labels to remind the most common cases: PC vs Mac byte order.
	This is more useful information to an artist :)

Wed Feb 17 23:36:45 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/color_balance.c (struct _ColorBalanceDialog): lookup tables
 	should be size 256, not 255.

1999-02-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimplutP.h: fixed error in struct declaration
	
1999-02-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimplut[FP].h: oops, these should have been added with the
 	last commit.

1999-02-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/gimplut.[ch]: new source files that implement pixel Look Up
 	Table functions.
	
	* app/Makefile.am: build gimplut.[ch]

	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/curves.c
	* app/invert.c
	* app/levels.c
	* app/posterize.c: Use the new lut functions.  Use
 	pixel_region_process_parallel in the PDB versions of these routines.

	* libgimp/parasite.h
	* libgimp/parasite.c: new functions parasite_name and
 	parasite_compare.
	
	* app/gimpdrawable.c:
	* app/gimpdrawable.h: new function
 	gimp_drawable_get_color_at(...) returns the RGBA[color index]
 	value at a specified position in the drawable.  Don't set the dirty
 	bit on the image if a new parasite is the same as the old.
	
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.h new function
 	gimp_image_get_color_at(...) returns the RGBA[color index]
 	value at a specified position in the drawable.  Don't set the dirty
 	bit on the image if a new parasite is the same as the old.
	
	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/color_picker.c: use the new gimp_*_get_color_at
 	functions instead of messing with the tiles.
	
	* app/layer.c: fixed a minor warning.

	* app/commands.c: 
	don't scale the image if the new size == the old size
	
	* app/channel.c: optimized channel_bounds by only checking the
 	pixels in a tile if it is not already entirely within the
 	currently computed bounds.
	
Mon Feb 15  21:14:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/prep4gif.pl
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/alpha2color.pl
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/windy.pl
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/feedback.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachlego.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachshadow.pl: added email addresses and 
       put things in a more sane spot in the menus

Mon Feb 15 05:23:18 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/color_balance.c (color_balance): Use the rgb_to_l function.

Sun Feb 14 22:16:16 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/paint_funcs.c app/paint_funcs.h : New function rgb_to_l for
 	when we only want the luminosity.  (rgb_to_hls): Use "else if" for
 	case which can't be true if previous test succeeded.

	* app/color_balance.c (struct _ColorBalanceDialog): use
	lookup tables with unsigned values for the RGB components.

Sun Feb 14 23:27:57 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* docs/parasites.txt: Added some suggestions from Jay Cox.

Sun Feb 14 4:28:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* plug-ins/sinus/sinus.c: changed macro definition supplied by
	Thomas to allow tilable sinus again.

Sun Feb 14 23:11:30 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* libgimp/gimptile.c (gimp_tile_cache_ntiles): Round up, not down,
	when setting the tilecachesize, in case we ever do 63x63 tiles ;)

Sun Feb 14 20:43:55 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/channels_dialog.c: don't #include resize.h - it's not needed
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: ditto.

	* app/resize.c: do all dialog creation here to factor out lots of
	     common code in commands.c and layers_dialog.c.  Also cancel
	     resize/scale dialog on destruction/removal of images/layers -
	     proper fix for Peter Teichman's bug.
	* app/resize.h: new prototype for resize_widget_new() - beginnings
	     of resolution-aware scaling.
	* app/commands.c: pull all the resize/scale dialog creation stuff
	     out to resize.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c: same again.

	* app/layer.c: add REMOVED signal, sent when a layer is removed
	     from an image.  Layers typically aren't destroyed until their
	     undo info expires.
	* app/layer.h: prototype for layer_removed() call.
	* app/gimpimage.c: send out removed signal.

Sun Feb 14 02:33:42 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: Corrected argument name.
	* docs/parasites.txt: Add some thoughts about parasite
	data formats.

1999-02-14  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: applied Michael Natterer's fix for the
 	layer movement bug.

Sun Feb 14 01:27:29 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	New manpage plus bumper fun pack of bugfixes.

	* gimprc.5.in: NEW FILE: beginnings of some docs on gimprc file
	     format.
	* configure.in: generate gimprc.5 from gimprc.5.in
	* Makefile.am: install gimprc.5
	* .cvsignore: ignore gimprc.5, it's auto generated.

	* gimp.1: fix a few paths and URLs.  Mention the modules/
	     directory in user's gimpdir.

	* app/commands.c: cancel resize or scale dialogs when image
 	     they're for is destroyed, rather than segfaulting when Ok is
 	     clicked.  Thanks to Peter Teichman <peter@zeno.dorm.duke.edu>
 	     for pointing this one out.  Layer resize/scale still suffers
 	     from same problem, but Adam's working on L&C at the moment.

	* app/gdisplay.c: off-by one error on bounds check in making image
	     title.

	* app/module_db.c: some would consider it foolish returning to
 	     code you've just unloaded.  So don't do that.

	* app/plug_in.c: when superceeding a PDB function with a newer one
	     of the same name, remove pointers to the old one from the
	     plugins that originally registered them.  Fixes Nick Lamb's
	     pluginrc file corruption thing, and catches the (common?)
	     error of copying a plugin to a different name but failing to
	     change what it registers.  Also, if registering a file
	     loader/saver, make sure it has set an extension, prefix, or
	     magic number it's interested in - that way code that relies
	     on checking this doesn't get confused.

Sat Feb 13 19:05:16 CET 1999 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* app/internal_procs.c
	* app/parasite_cmds.h
	* app/parasite_cmds.c
	* app/gimpparasite.h
	* app/gimpparasite.c
	* app/gimage_cmds.h
	* app/gimage_cmds.c
	* app/gimpimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/drawable_cmds.h
	* app/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/gimpdrawable.h
	* app/gimpdrawable.c
	
	Added parasite_list functions for global parasites, drawables and
	images as internal (C) and pdb functions.

Wed Feb 10 23:44:00 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: provide a simple way to change the 
	image_title_format string
	* app/scale.c: also update the title when using the zoom tool

Mon Feb  8 18:47:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/feedback.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachblocks.pl 
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/xachshadows.pl: Updated version
	information on my Gimp-Perl plugins that were improved by Marc
	Lehmann so I can keep track better.

Mon Feb  8 19:17:58 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/layer.c
	* app/selection.c: Turn off a layer's bounding box when
	it is deselected.

Mon Feb  8 12:12:18 CST 1999 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c: applied patch from Shuji Narazaki 
	  <narazaki@gimp.org> which adds bezier stroke.

Sun Feb  7 22:06:04 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/dialog_handler.c
	* app/fileops.c: Various bugfixes and speedups w.r.t.
	thumbnail loading.  Now has a 'generate thumbnail' button.

	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/curves.c
	* app/hue_saturation.c: Changed some gint to gint32.  It
	doesn't matter right now, but it might if the optimized
	CLAMP0255 gets fixed.

Sun Feb  7 18:29:26 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: A unidirectional error-spread makes
	the saddest little thumbnails taste full of country
	goodness.

	* app/appenv.c: Wow, CLAMP0255() has a bug that I can't
	quite see, or my compiler does.  Worked around it.

Sun Feb  7 15:04:23 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: More robust and kickin' thumbnail support.

	* app/edit_selection.c app/layer.c app/layer.h: Working
	on lazy opaque layer moves.  Disabled for now.

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimage.h
	* app/gimpimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.h
	* app/image_render.c
	* app/tile_manager.c: Errr, I don't remember.  No, seriously.
	Nothing of consequence.

Sun Feb  7 02:44:44 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: fix setting of $localedir, and use $CONFIG_SHELL
	to run config.status (variation upon gimp-joke-990122-1)

	* plug-ins/fp/fp_gtk.c: make label code consistent so we
	don't get confused (gimp-ruth-990131-0)

	* app/app_procs.c: toast stale swap files on startup

	* app/general.[ch]: removed prune_filename

	* app/by_color_select.c
	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c
	* app/fileops.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay_ops.c
	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/patterns.c: s/prune_filename/g_basename/

Sat Feb  6 18:16:57 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: gdisplay_format_title now parses a format string
	      set by the user to control what goes in the image window
	      titles. 
	* app/gdisplay.h: gdisplay_update_title() prototype.
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h: image-title-format added.
	* app/scale.c: update a display's title when zooming in/out
	
	* gimprc.in: sample image-title-format setting

Sat Feb  6 16:22:36 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-
		plug-ins/plugindetails/plugindetails.c
		app/devices.c

	Tidy up of plugindesc UI. Can now resize correctly.

	Fixed problem with session saving. If the active dialog 
	was not one on the toolbox (eg Histogram) then an error would
	be produced the next time gimp is run up.

Sat Feb  6 15:11:26 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpset.c
	* app/gimpset.h: remove the member_modified hacks
	* app/module_db.c: make module_info a proper object emitting a
	    modified signal.

1999-02-05  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/clone.c: merged the registered clone option from the
 	hollywood branch.  Made the source for unaligned clones reset
 	after each stroke.  Make sure we don't crash if the source
 	drawable gets destroyed.

Thu Feb  4 17:22:25 EST 1999 Peter Teichman  <pat4@acpub.duke.edu>

	* app/convolve.c: added pressure support for the Convolve tool

Wed Feb  3 18:12:19 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.2 release

	* configure.in: add plugindetails

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: add shared lib deps for glib/gtk

	* libgimp/gimpmatrix.c: use sizeof(GimpMatrix) instead of
	sizeof(double)*9, memcpy in gimp_matrix_duplicate instead
	of nested for loop

Thu Feb  4 00:23:26 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Tried again to add the plugin dir & files.

Thu Feb  4 00:07:13 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am

	New plugin located in plug-ins/plugindetails. Allows you to browse
	the plugin menu system.

Wed Feb  3 23:46:12 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: More work on thumbnailing - the
	Load Dialog now knows about thumbnails and shows them.
	Still some UI and code tidy-up remaining.

Tue Feb  2 23:34:37 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/datafiles.c
	* app/docindex.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/palette.c: use g_get_home_dir () instead of getenv ("HOME")

	* app/fileops.c: #warning is a gccism

	* app/invert.[ch]: minor cleanup

	* app/menus.c: more cleanups

	* app/blob.c: even more cleanups

	* libgimp/parasite.c: YACU

	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: CVS libtool 1.2e

	* modules/Makefile.am: use -module and -avoid-version flags

	* lic/Makefile.am
	* mapcolor/Makefile.am
	* xbm/Makefile.am: don't link with libjpeg here

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: new Adrian splash

1999-02-02  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.[ch] app/ink.c: Let the user choose between
	elliptical, square, and diamond shaped brushes for
	the ink tool.

Tue Feb  2 22:25:57 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: GIMP now automagically saves
	xv-compatible thumbnails upon image save.  More
	work soon.

	* app/fileops.c: Disabled gimage_set_save_proc()
	call which was causing files to continue saving
	in the same format regardless of the user's selected
	format.  Needs attention.

Tue Feb 02 20:58:40 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_set_name): Fix adding of
 	numbers after drawable copies. We used to get pairs of duplicates
 	after adding the same name several times. Thanks to Piet van Oostrum
	for reporting and diagnosing this.

1999-01-31  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/color_balance.c: optimized by using a lookup table
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: parallelized apply_mask_to_region, 
	combine_mask_and_region, and initial_region.  Use rand_r
	if we are multithreaded.

Sun Jan 31 18:02:46 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.c: Merged in changes from gsumi. This
	revision replaces the unstable conic-tracing code
	with old-fashioned floating point trig calls to
	compute the ellipses.

Sun Jan 31 19:42:26 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/tile.c, app/tile_manager.c:

	Fixed the tile-corruption bug which has been around
	since early GIMP-1.1.  When dirtying a copy-on-write
	tile, a pointer to nonsense data was being returned
	when the c-o-w'd tile source was swapped out to disk.
	Now the c-o-w'ing routine ensures that the tile data
	is correctly locked into memory before duplicating it
	for dirtying.

Sun Jan 31 17:13:46 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-

	* app/plug_in.c

	A mysterious semi-colon crept in....

Sun Jan 31 16:51:18 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Fix segfault when combining very
	tiny inten_a_inten_a regions (ie. when painting).

Sat Jan 30 23:51:04 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	Changed:-

	* app/dialog_handler.c
	* app/dialog_handler.h
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/plug_in.h

	Fixed problem with TAB key hiding all dialogs. With some WM
	you could hide all the windows with TAB then close the last image
	down... opps how do you get back to the main dialog. Main 
	dialog is now poped up when last image is closed and we had
	used TAB key to hide it.

	New PDB functions to query plugin info. Plugin to follow...

Sat Jan 30 23:47:37 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/menus.c (menus_init_mru): Don't g_snprintf into a NULL pointer.

Wed Jan 27 21:52:43 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/scale.c: oops - should use the image resolution, not the
	    screen resolution.  D'oh!

	* app/gimpdrawable.c: only merge shadow image if there actually is
	    one.

	* plug-ins/emboss/emboss.c: small optimisation: use
 	    gimp_drawable_mask_bounds() to calculate only the pixels that
 	    are actually in the selection.

Wed Jan 27 12:25:00 CST 1999 Seth Burgess <sbjurges@gimp.org>
	
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/add-bevel.scm: fixed the SF-ADJUSTMENT
	so that it shows up again.

Tue Jan 26 22:17:57 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/blob.c: s/(NONE|LEFT|RIGHT)/EDGE_$1/g to clear up namespace

	* app/menus.c: create dummy var to i18n File/MRU item
	(gimp-joke-9901122-1.patch)

	* app/tips_dialog.c: #include <config.h> (gimp-joke-9901122-1.patch)

Mon Jan 25 20:40:26 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* user_install: create modules/ directory in user's ~/.gimp-1.1 dir
	* app/install.c: include description of ~/.gimp-1.1/modules, plus
	    scroll info back to top when done inserting text since it
	    looks nicer.  Also make window that holds result of running
	    user_install a little larger so we see all messages at once.

	* app/gdisplay.h: FUNSCALE_{X,Y} macros for floating point
	    unscales.
	* app/scale.c: show rulers in real-world units (inches/cm/pixels)
	    if dot-for-dot is turned off, plus smoother ruler updates by
	    using FUNSCALE so we don't jump in pixel steps at high
	    magnification factors.
	* app/interface.c: don't set the ruler metrics for now - it's
 	    easier to do the calculations in pixels.  Need to rethink this
 	    a little anyway.

	* docs/parasites.txt: added jpeg parasite info.

Sat Jan 23 20:36:06 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/color_select.c: don't try and gdk_window_get_size() when we
	    haven't been realised yet.

	* app/gimpset.[ch]: allow the use of GTK_TYPE_NONE for storing
	    sets of things that aren't GTK_OBJECTs.  Set can also emit new
	    signal "member_modified" when gimp_set_member_modified (set,
	    ob) is called.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: show main dialog shell last, to avoid ugly
 	    window manager interaction.

	* app/module_db.c: can now handle not having any modules at all
	    without segfaulting, plus proper updates on changes.  Also now
	    has refresh button to re-scan the filesystem for modules.

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: added module_unload() function.
  	    Still needs someone to spruce up the UI.  Volunteers?

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/select_to_image.scm: create display
 	    for newly duplicated image, otherwise you don't see anything.

Sat Jan 23 18:43:23 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c: Multi-line comments, a little more
	sanity-checking.
	
	* app/convert.c: Cosmetic changes to the warning about having
	too many colours for saving transparent/animated GIFs.

	* app/gdisplay.c: Titlebar is correctly updated upon revert.

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Minor improvement.
	
	* docs/parasites.txt: Minor amendments.

	* plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: Minor code comment amendments.

1999-01-22  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/pixel_region.c, app/pixel_region.h: new function 
	pixel_regions_process_parallel
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: use pixel_regions_process_parallel in 
	combine_regions.  fixed bug in combine_inten_a_and_inten_a_pixels
	
	* app/gimprc.c, app/gimprc.h, app/preferences_dialog.c: added 
	num-processors variable

	* config.h.in, configure.in, acconfig.h: add configure option
 	--with-mp and define ENABLE_MP.
	
Thu Jan 21 22:58:00 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: new splash, from Shaw Terwilliger
	<sterwill@io.nu>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: turn DITHER_MAX on

Thu Jan 21 15:16:18 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/bucket_fill.c: correct typo in pdb invoker

Thu Jan 21 14:01:35 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: friggin C++ comments

Wed Jan 20 22:19:54 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.1.1 release

Wed Jan 20 20:45:23 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* HACKING: updated

	* configure.in: version number bump to 1.1

	* plug-ins/deinterlace/Makefile.am: don't list files from other
	directories

1999-01-20  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Satisfy a more pedantic `automake'.
	* plug-ins/blur/Makefile.am (blur_SOURCES): Don't list files from
	other directories.
	* plug-ins/borderaverage/Makefile.am (borderaverage_SOURCES): 
	Likewise.
	* plug-ins/emboss/Makefile.am (emboss_SOURCES): Likewise.
	* plug-ins/hot/Makefile.am (hot_SOURCES): Likewise.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DATA): Likewise.
	* plug-ins/webbrowser/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DATA): Likewise.

	Clean up handling of `tools/gcg' (partly due to a more pedantic
	automake).
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Emit tools/Makefile.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove @GCG@, add `tools'.
	* tools/Makefile.am: New file.
	(SUBDIRS): Conditionally build `gcg' subdir.

	(GCGMAKEDEPEND): Likewise.
	
Wed Jan 20 19:57:34 EST 1999 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* app/gradients.c
	  app/menus.c: 
	  s/gtk_check_menu_item_set_state/gtk_check_menu_item_set_active/
	  configure.in: upped gtk+ requirement to 1.1.13, since that's
	  where it first occurs.

Thu Jan 21 00:10:33 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: Backed out last change for now, since I'm a
	coward and yosh was threatening to make a release...!

Wed Jan 20 22:37:13 GMT 1999  Adam D. Moss  <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: Enabled the gimage->projection copy-on-write
	hack for RGBA/GRAYA single-layer images.  Masks/channels
	probably don't show yet when this is active.  Report strangeness.
	Thanks.

1999-01-20  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: connect the destroy signal of images to
 	lc_dialog_update_cb

1999-01-19  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/brush_select.c: make the edit button active if the default
 	brush is a generated brush.  Make sure brush spacing >= 1.0
	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: do not add a brush to the brush list if it
 	failed to load
	* app/gradient.c:  Fix typo that caused a crash with --no-data
	* app/main.c: be more forgiving of fp rounding in gserialize tests

Mon Jan 18 23:36:57 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: include module browser, plus re-instate the 'swap
	     colors' and other options that got killed by mistake.  Clean
	     up the odd extra separator too.

	* app/color_notebook.c: hide newly created colour selectors so we
	     know the GIMP one will be the default page.

	* app/module_db.[ch]: NEW FILEs: module database / browser.
	* app/Makefile.am: add module_db.[ch] stuff
	* app/app_procs.c: initialise the module_db
	* app/commands.[ch]: callback to create a module browser.
	* app/plug_in.c: move module loading out to module_db.c
	* libgimp/gimpmodule.h: API change: module_init() should return
	     additonal info (author, purpose, date, etc.)   Also optional
	     module_unload() function.
	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c: add module info, plus an unload function

	* modules/Makefile.am: build triangle colour selector module
	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: NEW FILE: colour selector from 
	     Simon Budig <Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>.

	* MAINTAINERS: changed my email address

Mon Jan 18 22:55:19 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c app/gimpimage.h:

	Part one of an effort to allow a one-layer gimage
	to share tiles with its own projection courtesy of
	copy-on-write, where sane.  This can save megabytes
	when working with such images.

	The code is 'mostly working' rather than 'perfect',
	so it's disabled until I have time to finish it.

Mon Jan 18 18:56:05 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: Better guess at how PSD files store
	Guide position precision.

Sun Jan 17 22:42:26 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h app/gimage_cmds.c:
	
	An image's projection is now copy-on-write duplicated
	upon duplication of the image.  This should save some
	time and memory for 'duplicate'.

	This needed a new function which is prototyped in gdisplay.h:
	gdisplays_finish_draw() which completes all outstanding
	idlerendered-projections (we don't want to c-o-w an
	incomplete projection).

	* app/interface.c: #include "dialog_handler.h"

Sun Jan 17 20:36:45 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage_cmds.c app/gimpimage.c app/layers_dialog.c

	Guides are now duplicated upon image duplication.
	Guides are now scaled upon image scaling.
	Lowering, raising, and renaming a layer now correctly
	mark the image as dirty.

Sun Jan 17 18:28:58 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c app/paint_funcs.c: Fixed a thinko/bug
	in the recent optimizations.

Sun Jan 17 16:56:25 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c app/bucket_fill.c app/convert.c app/crop.c
	app/cursorutil.c app/cursorutil.h app/dialog_handler.c
	app/dialog_handler.h app/fuzzy_select.c app/gdisplay.c
	app/gimage_cmds.c app/gimpimage.c app/scroll.c
	app/transform_core.c app/xcf.c

	Hourglasses also apply to all registered dialogs.  Hourglasses
	added in a couple more important places.  New hack lets
	hourglasses be added and automagically removed again when
	gimp/gtk re-enters the idle loop.

Sat Jan 16 18:21:58 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@greenend.org.uk>

	* plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: re-wrote the gimp-comment stuff so it
 	works with older libjpeg libraries without cinfo.marker_list
 	support.  While there, added support for loading and saving
 	resolution info.

1999-01-15  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Updated gtk_toggle_button_set_state() to
	gtk_toggle_button_set_active() in all the files.

Wed Jan 13 16:12:35 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/colormaps.c
	* app/devices.h
	* app/tips_dialog.h: minor cleanups

	* app/gimpimage.c: the dirty/clean handling seemed weird, and wasn't
	correct in all cases. Just do a straight increment/decrement to
	try to fix it.

Thu Jan 14 00:02:56 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h
	* config.h
	* configure.in: check for progressive mode in libjpeg

	* plug-ins/jpeg/jpeg.c: applied a patch from 
	Pete <pwhiting@fury.ittc.ukans.edu> that introduces comments
	and progressive saving for JPEGs

	
Tue Jan 12 23:25:46 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: doh, we build tool menus on the fly

	* configure.in: add nl.po to ALL_LINGUAS

	* acinclude.m4
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: upgrade to libtool 1.2d (with fixes for irix6 and osf)

Mon Jan 11 18:11:32 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c: small patch from Nick Lamb that
	does "The Right Thing (TM)" for RGB tiff images

Mon Jan 11 17:30:06 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* commands.[ch]
	* fileops.[ch]
	* gdisplay.[ch]
	* menus.c: implemented File->Revert

Mon Jan 11 22:02:10 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c:
	The bottleneck combine_inten_a_and_inten_a_pixels()
	function is a couple of times faster when there is a
	layer mask, for the common case, due to working with whole
	word-aligned ints where feasible instead of a char at a time.
	The same optimization could be implemented in lots of other
	places, but I'm going to bed.  Good night!

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: #include "cursorutil.h"

Mon Jan 11 21:35:44 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: build the Makefile in the modules directory

1999-01-10  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Use `test -f' instead of `test -e'.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Generate `plug-ins/perl/*' after `plugins/Makefile',
	so that the `plug-ins' directory exists before the `mkdir
	plug-ins/perl' is executed.

Sun Jan 11 00:24:21 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@greenend.org.uk>

	Bit of a large checkin this - it's basically three things:
	  1 - GimpModules using gmodules to dynamically load and
	       initialise modules at gimp start of day.
	  2 - Color selectors now register themselves with a color
	       notebook.
	  3 - progress bars have been cleaned up a bit, so now have
	       progress indictations on all transform tool and gradient
	       fill operations.  Not done bucket fill, but that seems to
	       be the next candidate.

	New directories:
	* modules/: new directory for dynamically loadable modules.

	New files:
	* modules/.cvsignore
	* modules/Makefile.am
	* modules/colorsel_gtk.c: GTK color selector wrapped up as a
	    color selector the gimp can use.

	* app/gimpprogress.[ch]: progress bars within gimp core, either as
	    popups, or in the status bar.  This is mainly code moved out
	    of plug-in.c

	* app/color_notebook.[ch]: color selector notebook, implementing
	    very similar interface to color_select.h so it can be used as
	    a drop-in replacement for it.

	* libgimp/color_selector.h: API color selectors need to implement
	    to become a page in the color_notebook.

	* libgimp/gimpmodule.h: API gimp modules need to implement to be
	    initialised by gimp at start of day.

	Modified files:
	* Makefile.am: add modules/ to SUBDIRS
	* libgimp/Makefile.am: install gimpmodule.h and color_selector.h
	* app/gimprc.[ch]: recognise module-path variable.
	* gimprc.in: set module-path variable to something sensible
	    (currently "${gimp_dir}/modules:${gimp_plugin_dir}/modules").
	* app/Makefile.am: build color notebook and gimpprogress
	* app/app_procs.c: register internal GIMP color selector with
	    color notebook.
	* app/asupsample.c: call progress function less frequently for
	    better performance.
	* app/asupsample.h: progress_func_t typedef moved to gimpprogress.h
	* app/blend.c: make callbacks to a progress function
	* app/color_area.c: use a color notebook rather than a color selector
	* app/color_panel.c: ditto
	* app/color_select.c: export color selector interface for notebook
	* app/color_select.h: color_select_init() prototype
	* app/flip_tool.c: flip the image every time, rather than every
	    second click.
	* app/interface.c: move progress bar stuff out to
	    gimpprogress.c.  Make the code actually work while we're at it.
	* app/interface.h: move prototypes for progress functions out to
	    gimpprogress.h
	* app/plug_in.c: load and initialise modules (if possible). Move
	    progress bar handling code out to gimpprogress.c
	* app/plug_in.h: keep only a gimp_progress * for each plugin, not
	    a whole bunch of GtkWidgets.
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/shear_tool.c
	* app/perspective_tool.c: progress bar during operation.
	    De-sensitise the dialog to discourage the user from running
	    two transforms in parallel.
	* app/transform_core.c: recalculate grid coords when bounding box
	    changes.  Only initialise the action area of the dialog once,
	    to avoid multiple "ok" / "reset" buttons appearing.  Undraw
	    transform tool with correct matrix to get rid of handle
	    remains on screen.  Call a progress function as we apply the
	    transform matrix.  A few new i18n markups.  Invalidate
	    floating selection marching ants after applying matrix.
	* app/transform_core.h: transform_core_do() takes an optional
	    progress callback argument (and data).
	* plug-ins/oilify/oilify.c: send progress bar updates after every
	    pixel region, not only if they processed a multiple of 5
	    pixels (which was quite unlikely, and therefore gave a jerky
	    progress indication).

Sun Jan 10 23:31:45 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c app/bucket_fill.c app/convert.c app/crop.c
	app/cursorutil.c app/cursorutil.h app/fuzzy_select.c
	app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h app/gimage_cmds.c
	app/gimpimage.c app/transform_core.c app/xcf.c:

	Most lengthy UI-blocking operations now put up an
	hourglass so the user can see that GIMP is working.
	Let me know if there are other vital cases.

Sun Jan 10 22:41:51 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	New
	* app/dialog_handler.c
	* app/dialog_handler.h

	Changed
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gradient_select.c
	* app/tools.c

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/devices.c
	* app/errorconsole.c

	Can now hide/show all main dialogs using the TAB key in any window.
	However....
	there is a bug in gtk that causes the Gimp the crash if you show
	and then hide a lot of dialogs (eg if you have all dialogs visible
	and press the TAB key repeatedly). I have email-ed an example to
	the gtk bug list.
	Also I can't seem to be able to catch the SHIFT-TAB combination
	(suggestions welcome ;-) so the first press of the tab hide all 
	dialogs the second press reshows only the toolbox and the third
	press reshows all. Comments please if you find this behaviour 
	non-intuitive.

Sun Jan 10 21:42:11 GMT 1999  Austin Donnelly  <austin@greenend.org.uk>

Sun Jan 10 20:44:07 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Disabled debug output of [.!..!!] for COW

Sun Jan 10 20:13:13 GMT 1999 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: 
	Greatly reduced memory requirements for layered image loading -
	we now do just-in-time channel unpacking.  Some little
	cleanups too.

Sat Jan  9 21:24:20 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: rework to do gcg by ourselves

Sun Jan 10 01:43:06 EST 1999  Peter Teichman  <pat4@acpub.duke.edu>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c: didn't realize that there
	were more errors of the same type.. The wrong callback argument
	was being dereferenced for most GtkScale objects.

Sat Jan  9 03:42:30 EST 1999 Peter Teichman  <pat4@acpub.duke.edu>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c (angle_update): fixed a
	segfault.. The wrong argument to angle_update was being dereferenced.

Thu Jan  7 15:45:14 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added pl to ALL_LINGUAS

Thu Jan  7 21:33:39 EET 1999 Lauri Alanko <nether@gimp.org>

	* app/colormap_dialog.gc
	* app/colormap_dialog.i.c

	* app/main.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/undo.c:

	Redid the indexed palette dialog to not crash, to be a bit more
	usable, and to be a cleaner module. A first shot at using gcg in
	actual practice..

	If something is screwed, let me know!
	
	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* libgimp/gimp.h:

	Now keep a local copy of temp proc names

Wed Jan  6 23:30:03 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	* app/indexed_palette.c

	Fixed crash when image->dialog->indexed palette invoked on
	an RGB image.

Mon Jan  4 23:21:56 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	* app/blend.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c

	A patch from Federico to add a spiral gradient type. The patch
	has been slightly modified to allow both clockwise and anticlockwise
	spirals and the numbers used to represent these types of gradients
	have been made to follow on from currently allocated numbers (I hope
	this will not break any scripts). 

Sun Jan  3 14:40:27 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ps/ps.c: new version

Sun Jan  3 22:18:48 MET 1999 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/palette.c: applied a patch from Michael Natterer
	that fixes a segfault in the palette dialog.

Sat Jan  2 23:22:29 GMT 1999 Andy Thomas <alt@picnic.demon.co.uk>

	* app/palette.c
	* app/palette_select.h
	* app/palette_select.c

	An attempt at a better/improved palette dialog using a notebook
	style for selection.

Sat Jan  2 15:26:31 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am: use -DREGEX_MALLOC,
	seems to be more portable

	* plug-ins/png/png.c: use a default gamma of 2.2 when gamma
	correction isn't enabled

Fri Jan  1 19:28:23 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/blend.c: remove bogus constification

	* po/sv.po: updates from Tomas Ogren <stric@ing.umu.se>

Fri Dec 25 10:01:19 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* i18n markings from Daniel Egger (mostly removal of tags around
	PDB stuff), some constification

	* I went on a sprintf pogrom. Use g_snprintf or g_strdup_printf
	where applicable, to prevent overflows, especially with filenames
	and translated strings. suid gimp is now more secure. ;)

	added a sanity check to the resolution loading.

Wed Dec 16 13:27:23 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: removed my_gtk_label_set, since the underlying
	implementation changed. Why was this there anyway?

1998-12-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: fixed a bug in combine_inten_and_inten_a_pixels.
	Use INT_MULT and friends everywhere possible.

1998-12-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* libgimp/gserialize.c
	* libgimp/gserialize.h: Changed the enum values to allow for
 	simpler future expansion.
	
	* libgimp/parasite.c
	* libgimp/parasite.h: s/persistant/persistent/.
 	new accessor functions for parasites.  #defines for new flags.

	* app/paintbrush.c: added timeing code for brush strokes.
  	It is #ifed out, and is only valid for shift clicks.

	* app/parasitelist.h
	* app/parasitelist.c: added _for_each and _length functions

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.h: declare some struct variable as extern.
	
	* app/paint_funcs.c: Lots of optimizations aimed at speeding up
 	painting.  Should see a 2-4X speed up on most painting
 	(depending on paint modes, brush size etc.)

	* app/drawable.c: check for NULL drawable in drawable_ID.
  	this stops us from being crashed by ill-behaved plug-ins

Tue Dec 15 16:18:40 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/*: stuff from patches/i18n by Daniel Egger

	* app/gdisplay.[ch]
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/interface.c: I guess finally we have the coordinates 
	display working with all font sizes and even after scaling the
	image

Sat Dec 12 17:36:51 GMT 1998  Austin Donnelly  <austin@greenend.org.uk>

	* app/interface.c
	* app/gdisplay.c: tweak to make status bar update correctly (most
 	of the time).  As Sven has already noted, there seems to be a GTK
 	bug involved.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: only update the cursor co-ords if we
 	actually know them.  Gets rid of silly (0,0) announcements.

Thu Dec 10 19:09:53 CET 1998 Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>

	* configure.in: check only for "perl", not "perl5.005xx".

	* app/image_render.c
	* app/info_window.c
	* app/magnify.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/scale.c: image rendering now happens with float scale
	factors, independent in X and Y axes.  Turning on dot-for-dot in view
	menu does what gimp always used to do (ie one image pixel becomes
	one monitor pixel).  Dot-for-dot is on by default so people
	shouldn't notice any difference unless they load an image that's
	not at 72 dpi and also turn off dot-for-dot.

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.[ch]
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: new gimprc options
	(monitor-xresolution <float>) and corresponding
 	(monitor-yresolution <float>).  Uglyness in preferences dialog to
	add a "Monitor" page to the notebook, allowing user to set their
	monitor's resolution or take it from the X server instead.  This
	badly needs cleaned up :(

	* plug-ins/newsprint/newsprint.c: oops - this hasn't been working
	for grayscale images since my last checkin.  Now fixed.

Sat Dec  5 02:40:52 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

Sat Dec  5 04:27:44 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpentry.[ch]: New files. Adds a new widget 
	that allows to specify lengths in pixels, inches and centimeters.
	It is tested, but not yet used anywhere.  As I don't have the time 
	to finish this now, I add this here for later use or for someone else 
	to integrate it into all gimp dialogs...

Fri Dec  4 01:43:59 EST 1998 Nick Fetchak <nuke@bayside.net>

	* app/crop.[ch]: Added option to crop the active layer only

Fri Nov 27 17:34:57 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* app/ink.c: Use MAX when combining multiple blobs,
	instead of previous technique.	This gives _much_ 
	better results.

Fri Nov 27 11:45:03 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/devices.c (devices_restore): changed silent return on
	device_info == NULL to a g_warning_if_fail (now that Gtk+ is fixed,
	this case should never happen).

Wed Nov 25 18:37:44 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* plug-ins/gz/gz.c: We don't need GTK+, and we
	don't use GTK_CFLAGS, so don't include <gtk/gtk.h>.

Wed Nov 25 22:26:11 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c (ink_pen_ellipse): Added yet another slider, this time

	* plug-ins/tiff/tiff.c: gimp_image_{get,set}_resolution() calls
	now get and set both X and Y resolutions.  Gimp image struct now

Wed Nov 11 04:18:57 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: fix buglet with making GLIB_LIBS (shouldn't have

	* libgimp/gimpmatrix.[ch]
	* app/transform_core.c: minimal speedup

	* app/scale_tool.c: Use transform_core_do() for scaling too.

	rework

1998-11-08  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* New libgimp/gimppatternmenu.c

	Pattern dialog can now be controlled via the PDB. New widget (not true
	widget) type added to libgimpui (gimp_pattern_select_widget()). Plugins
	should easily be able to control & select patterns. Script-fu
	updated to use new widget. See the test script for example.

	* app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h: Okay, that didn't
	take quite as long as expected.  This is the first cut at
	a gimp-wide IdleRender in place of the previously synchronous
	displays_update().  A synchronous displays_update_now() is
	implemented for stuff like brushes, but it isn't used right
	now.  (Seems to go pretty well without.)

	I need feedback and (previously nonexistant!) bug reports...
	please. =)

	Temporarily disabled IdleRender code whilst working

Wed Sep 30 10:48:00 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@ou.edu>
	* gimp_tips.txt: Ran it through ispell

1998-09-29  Sung-Hyun Nam  <namsh@lgic.co.kr>

	* po/ko.po: New file with Korean translations (some).
	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added 'ko'

Mon Sep 28 18:08:14 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif.c: Fixed an uninitialized variable bug
	which was making TigerT's gifs blow up.  Sigh!

Sun Sep 27 13:53:03 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_funcs.c: Fixed a bug in color_only_pixels(),
	fixed a possible bug in border_region().

Sat Sep 26 20:46:18 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.c app/channel_ops.c app/drawable.c
	app/floating_sel.c app/gdisplay.c app/gdisplay.h
	app/gimpimage.c app/layers_dialog.c app/undo.c:

	Moved the idlerender stuff into gdisplay.c.  Implemented
	idlerender when doing floating_sel->layer, and undoing/redoing
	layer deletion.

	idlerender would be useful in many other places for improving
	interactivity, if it weren't for the following problems:

		* By definition, idlerender doesn't wait for a
		gdisplays_update() call	before starting work - it just
		runs in idle time, which due to CPU contention with
		plugins may not	be genuinely available idle time when
		things are 'noninteractive'.

		* Most GIMP functions don't know whether they're
		being run interactively or not.  idlerender only
		makes sense for interactive work.  This is why
		it is currently only applied to those functions which
		would normally only be activated manually.

		* Mixing idlerender and drawable_update() /
		gdisplays_update_area() calls can lead to a region
		being rerendered twice.

	Hence, some slogwork is needed before idlerender can be
	applied in the more general case.

Sat Sep 26 00:54:14 EDT 1998   Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*gimptool.1: minor update to add info about -strip
	build options.

Fri Sep 25 18:05:39 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: Tied up some loose ends.

Thu Sep 24 12:39:27 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/brush_edit.c: #include <string.h> for memset

	* app/layers_dialog.c:

	Display re-rendering is now handled in an interruptible
	asynchronous idle-threaded, uh, paradigm shift.

	The upshot of this is that fiddling about with layers
	in the layers dialog is now a shipload faster for some
	common operations.

	Still needs to be ratified w.r.t. multiple gimages, but
	it's there.

Mon Sep 21 02:05:50 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text_tool.c: correct test for restoring old foundry in
	callback (from Trent Piepho)

	* plug-ins/gauss_iir/gauss_iir.c
	* plug-ins/gauss_rle/gauss_rle.c: better test for bad values,
	put fix in gauss_rle too

Sun Sep 20 15:52:21 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Upgraded to libtool 1.2b

	* Reversioned libgimp to use gtk-style without a funky soname

	* configure.in: craft GLIB_CFLAGS and GLIB_LIBS

	* Makefile.am (pretty much all of em): changed to use new library
	naming scheme. Only link libgimpui and libgtk et al to the plugins
	that actually need them.

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: corrected typo that resulted in corrupt PDB
	record

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpwire.h
	* libgimp/gimpmenu.[ch]: clean up the callback code

	* Removed unecessary inclusion of gtk headers for plugins that
	don't use em

	* plug-ins/zealouscrop/zealouscrop.c: use gint8 instead of gboolean,
	save some mem

	* plugged some warnings in animationplay, flame, fp, gee, gfig

	* gimptool.in: changes for library reversioning, added --nogimpui
	option for not linking in libgimpui

	* configure.in: added finnish translation

Sun Sep 20 12:57:00 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gauss_iir/gauss_iir.c: Fixed segfault if neither
	horizontal nor vertical was selected (as reported by Marc Lehman).

	libgimp/gimp.h libgimp/gimpmenu.c libgimp/gimptile.c
	plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c

	Infrastructure to allow gimp dialogs to be controlled from plugins.
	Brush dialog can now be invoked multiple times. Dialogs invoked
	via plugins do not control the active brush (dialog only used for
	selections).
	New gimp_interactive_selection_brush() function to popup dialog
	Example of usage in the gfig plugin.
	Other dialogs should be able to use this method of invocation.

Tue Sep 15 21:27:10 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif.c:
	The facility to specify the background colour of
	a transparent/animated GIF for non-transparent
	viewers now works very much more consistantly.
	The only situations in which it will fail to work
	as expected now are those where file size can be reduced
	(abeit not by much, as the plugin is sometimes more pessimistic
	than it need be) by re-using an existing unused colour
	index rather than using another bit per pixel in the
	encoded file.  That will never be an issue with an image
	which was freshly converted from RGB to INDEXED with the
	Quantize option, as that option removes any unused colours
	from the image.

	Let me know if you find the consistancy/size tradeoff more
	annoying than helpful and I can adjust it.  IMHO it is too
	arcane a feature to present to any user as a runtime option.

	* app/ink.c: #include <string.h> for a memset

	PDB interface for running arbitrary scheme code

	* app/batch.c: redid batch mode to use script-fu-eval

	* app/main.c: fixed command line parsing for batch mode and
	image loading

Wed Sep  9 03:02:17 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added -std1 check for DU4

	* gimptool.in: added strip options

	* plug-ins/hrz/hrz.c: #ifndef'd NeXT out munmap call

	* plug-ins/maze/maze.c: commented out some debug code differently
	so NeXT compiler won't barf.

	* configure.in
	* po/sv.po: added a preliminary Swedish translation from
	Tomas Ogren <stric@ing.umu.se>

Tue Sep  8 18:28:44 1998  Jay Cox  (jaycox@earthlink.net)

	* app/brush_generated.c: more carefull when the active brush
	  changes
	* app/docindexif.c: white_space() was ungetch'ing the eof
	  marker which can clear the eof flag on some systems.
	* app/docindex.c: check for ferror()s
	* app/brush_select[ch]: sensitize the edit button iff the
	  active brush is a generated brush.

Mon Sep  7 22:30:53 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c: s/ATEXIT/g_atexit/ to sync with gtk changes

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c: #if 0'd out some dead code

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c: removed unused variable
	declaration

Fri Sep  4 17:48:42 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: Added the ability to load
	Guides info from PSD files.

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: Don't allow careless callers
	to add Guides outside of the image boundaries.

Tue Sep  1 18:32:39 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.1: minor updates to the gimptool
	man page to cover more of the kitchen sink.

Tue Sep  1 23:00:42 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/guillotine/Makefile.am configure.in
	plug-ins/guillotine/guillotine.c plug-ins/Makefile.am:
	New plugin to slice an image up along its Guides.

	* app/gimage_cmds.c: Fixes.

	app/gimpimage.h libgimp/gimp.h libgimp/gimpenums.h
	libgimp/gimpimage.c: Moved the guide PDB functions into
	a more sensible place, made them accessible to plugins
	through libgimp.

Tue Sep  1 01:15:06 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c (paint_mode_menu_get_position): added this
	function to translate layer modes to correct menu positions, this
	is ugly but important until someone rewrites the layers_dialog.

Mon Aug 31 23:32:40 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_remove_layer_mask): add back a call to
	gdisplays_flush that seems to have been lost in the
	objectification.

Mon Aug 31 15:15:01 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/color_select.c (color_select_update_colors): made it use the
	color_area rectangle draw so it dithers.

	* app/color_area.[ch] (color_area_draw_rect): made it draw the color
	rectangle with gdkrgb (so it gets dithered) rather than the
	rectangle drawing primitive.

	* app/gximage.[ch] (gximage_put): made it align dithers

	* app/gdisplay.c (gdisplay_display_area): made it so that the
	gximage_put routine gets dither alignment values

Mon Aug 31 16:51:35 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/internal_procs.c: included in merge down changes

Mon Aug 31 16:33:11 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

 	* app/gimpimage.[ch]
	* app/gimage_cmds.[ch]
	* app/layers_dialog.c: Added merge down procedure, I'm not really
	sure if this behaves the way people expect it to, so please send
	me any comments on what it actually should do.  It also needs a
	little testing, especially the pdb call.

	* app/gimpimage.c: cleaned up Seth's merge commit a little. Also
	changed the mode of a merged layer to normal, as this seems to be
	the proper thing.  Discussion is welcome here as well.

Mon Aug 31 19:16:36 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: I'm pleased to say that lewing doesn't
	want to kill me any more.  Hooray!

Mon Aug 31 18:15:16 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage.h app/gimpimage.c app/gimpimage.h
	app/internal_procs.c app/layer.c app/xcf.c:
	Guide creation/deletion/query is now available as
	PDB procedures.  Not yet directly exported to libgimp,
	and needs to be moved into gimage_cmds.c, but it
	works.

Mon Aug 31 11:35:00 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* app/gimage.c
	* app/gimpimage.c: Applied Zach's fix for layer merge opacity.  I
	still don't really like setting opacity to 100% regardless, but at
	least it looks like it behaves correctly.

Sun Aug 30 19:02:56 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/*/Makefile.am: removed -lc from all Makefiles, since it
	causes weird problems on DU4

Sun Aug 30 16:45:05 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/app_procs.c (app_init_update_status): Instead
	of calling gtk_widget_draw() (which was happening before
	the labels got re-size-allocated), just update the
	event loop so the idle resize/redraw gets run.

Sat Aug 29 15:32:32 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/main.c: quell warning to g_set_message_handler

	* app/about_dialog.c: fix off-by-one error for space for the about
	text

Fri Aug 28 15:56:41 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h
	* configure.in
	* app/main.c: added check for putenv and #ifdefed it's usage since
	NeXTStep is lame

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/main.c
	* app/plug_in.c: conditionally compile shared mem stuff so platforms
	without it can still work

	* plug-ins/CEL/CEL.c
	* plug-ins/palette/palette.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-escp2.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-pcl.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-ps.c: s/strdup/g_strdup/ for portability

Wed Aug 26 16:30:36 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* app/gradient.c (grad_create_gradient_editor,
	cpopup_create_color_item): Turned on dithering in the previews.

Tue Aug 25 14:55:25 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.in: use LDFLAGS and LIBS for building too

Mon Aug 24 13:41:49 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c (file_save): move the mru and docindex calls to
	before the call to gimp_image_set_filename so that they are still
	accessing valid memory.  Fixes the filename corruption seen in
	these interfaces.
	* app/gimpimage.c: added a warning about the side effect that
	caused the above bug.

Mon Aug 24 09:34:37 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/depthmerge.c
	* plug-ins/fli.[ch]
	* plug-ins/gfli.c: updates from the registry

	* plug-ins/pnm/pnm.c: fix for non-interactive mode

	* plug-ins/fractaltrace/fractaltrace.c: minor code cleanups

Mon Aug 24 09:20:38 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: make xdelta not built by default, so poor users
	aren't confused

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/blob.c
	* app/errors.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c: fixes for glib changes with
	s/g_debug/g_on_error_debug/ and s/g_vsprintf/g_strdup_vprintf/

Fri Aug 21 17:25:34 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: fixed a lingering bug that occured from the
	removal of the id system.  This should fix tigert's save problems.

1998-08-21  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/docindexif.c (create_idea_menu):
	* app/docindex.c (make_idea_window):
		Got rid of the menu bar in the document index.

1998-08-19  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	This is the GdkRgb integration.

	* app/gximage.c (gximage_put): Uses gdk_draw_rgb_image rather
	than gdk_draw_image.

	* app/image_render.c: gutted most of this, as it is now subsumed
	by GdkRgb. In the process, gamma != 1.0 doesn't work anymore.
	Also, speedups are almost certainly possible in a bunch of cases.

	* app/info_window.c (get_shades): compiles and runs, but is
	not functional.

	* app/colormaps.c: gutted

	* app/color_select.c: changed dither to max

	A few things remain: the dithering is _not_ correctly aligned for
	scrolling - looks like I'll need to add some more API to GdkRgb
	for that. The gradient editor needs to be set to maximum
	dithering. I'd like to draw the foreground and background colors
	dithered so they don't quantize so much in 8bpp modes.

Wed Aug 19 21:00:00 PDT 1998 Ray Lehtiniemi <rayl@netrover.com>

	* app/airbrush.c gdisplay.c gimage.h gimpimage.c gimpimage.h
	gimpimageP.h image_render.c indexed_palette.c info_window.c
	layers_dialog.c:

	Remove the distinction between flat and layered gimages.  now
	gimages always allocate a projection, even if there is only a
	single layer.

	Fix some gcc-isms.

Tue Aug 18 15:42:44 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: kludged around the use of the disappearing
	gtk private functions (through the magic of cut and paste ;)

Sun Aug 16 18:48:17 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c (ink_paste): Make sure we check that
	ink_set_paint_area found a valid canvas_buf.

1998-08-16  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/docindexif.c: Fixed up the UI to make the document index
	look a bit more like a dialog.

	* app/docindex.h:
	* app/docindex.c: Just fixed a few small nits.  Might have made
	the document index a bit more robust during gimp crashes.

Sat Aug 15 22:53:36 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c (gdisplay_update_cursor): Make sure we check the
	return value from gimp_image_active_drawable.

Sat Aug 15 19:30:42 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* Makefile.am boundary.h boundaryF.h by_color_select.h
	  file_new_dialog.c fileops.h floating_sel.h gdisplay.h
	  gdisplayF.h ink.c interface.h layer.h layerF.h paint_core.h
	  tools.h toolsF.h: header file tweaks.  Now changing tile.h
	  doesn't force about_dialog to recompile! :)

Sat Aug 15 16:53:45 CDT 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/airbrush.c: added a debug warning to a case that previously
	caused a segfault.  This appears to be an xinput related problem
	where more than one button press can occur before a button release,
	so if you see a warning that tells you to contact me, please do.

Sat Aug 15 14:09:12 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/transform_core.c (transform_core_do): Fixed a merge error
	that I missed on the last commit.

	* blend.c boundary.c by_color_select.c channel.c color_picker.c
 	  convert.c drawable_cmds.c file_new_dialog.c flip_tool.c

 	  scale_tool.c shear_tool.c text_tool.c tile_manager.c
 	  tile_manager.h tile_manager_pvt.h transform_core.c undo.c xcf.c:

	  Another tile tweak.  This one eliminates tile levels (which add
 	  bookkeeping without being used).  Made copy_region more
 	  intelligent on when to use tile sharing; some changes made to
 	  pixel_regions to facilitate this.  Fixed a refcount problem with
 	  xcf load and probably a few other bugs that I've forgotten
 	  about.  Added a sanity check in set_undo_tiles to help with a
 	  problem larry is reporting with airbrush and xinput.

Sat Aug 15 16:11:07 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* TODO: updated the TODO file
	Well, this is going to be my last commitment to the gimp for a
	few months. Have fun coding, folks! I'm looking forward to see
	a nice 1.2 version out there, when I'm back.

Sat Aug 15 15:27:39 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/shear_tool.c: We have entries in the info dialog now that
	allow to enter exact values for the transformations and crop.

	* app/transform_core.c
	* app/transform_tool.c: Changed "Clip perspective" to "Clip result"
	and made it available for all transformations.

	* app/rect_select.c

Fri Aug 14 16:40:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_tool.c
	* app/transform_core.[ch]: Added a "Show grid" toggle. Fixed a
	problem that occured when changing the grid size before the tool
	is created. Don't draw the grid if the perspective trafo is too
	weird.

Thu Aug 13 23:00:39 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts: tileblur.scm, title-header.scm,
	trochoid.scm,truchet.scm, unsharp-mask.scm, waves-anim.scm,
	weave.scm,xach-effect.scm: first wave of scripts to
	use some of the new script-fu options

Thu Aug 13 22:20:06 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_tool.[ch]: minor cosmetic changes

Thu Aug 13 22:16:42 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	Applied the patch from Tor Lillqvist <tml@iki.fi>:

	* app/transform_core.c app/transform_core.h: Further changes in
	the look-and-feel. Now we have a info_dialog window for each
	transformation tool, with an action and cancel button. The use of
	shift-clicking to approve the transform introduced in
	gimp-tml-980724-1 is still there. The old immediate transformation
	on button release is gone.

	For use by the rotate tool we have a center-of-rotation point
	which is draggable. Its coordinates are kept in the TransformCore
	struct.

	As there no longer are several related transformations done after
	each other as in the old look-and-feel, we don't need the _first_
	field in TransformUndo.

	Added the function _transform_core_grid_density_changed_ called
	from transform_tool.c when the grid density spinbutton has been
	changed. The grid is instantaneously redrawn in the new
	density. Neat, huh?

	* transform_tool.c transform_tool.h: More options: a toggle to
	clip the result of a perspective transform, and a spinbutton for
	the rubber-band grid density. The toggle for "new" vs. "old" UI is
	now for "corrective" vs. "traditional" paradigm.

	* rotate_tool.c: Show also the center point coordinates in the
	info dialog. If dragging the center point, update TransformCore
	accordingly. Use the center point coordinates from TransformCore
	where appropriate.

	* perspective_tool.c: Show the transformation matrix in the info
	dialog.

	* undo.c: TransformUndo no longed has the _first_ field, code
	simplified thusly.

Thu Aug 13 20:48:48 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/color_area.c: Add event-masks so the tooltip is shown.

	* app/gdisplay.c

	Tooltips added to items in device status dialog box.
	Fixed problem with multiple input devices & new dialog.
	Added option to preferences (under session) that allows user to
	always store device status on exit from gimp (default off).
	Fixed problem in color area of toolbar to do the possibility of GC not
	existing when the dialog is refreshed.

	* app/commands.c: include errorconsole.h

Tue Aug 11 23:17:20 CST 1998 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_core.c: Fixed the flip tool so it would operate

	* app/app_procs.c

	drawable_cmds.c fuzzy_select.c gimpimage.c image_render.c ink.c
	layer.c paint_core.c paint_funcs.c pixel_region.c plug_in.c undo.c
	xcf.c: eliminated references to tile private data

	possible

Mon Aug 10 14:48:20 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/drawable.c (drawable_fill): added a case for

	* app/layers_dialog.c (lc_dialog_create): moved
	gtk_widget_show (lc_shell) so that the layers show up in the

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/interface.c: Changed progressbar updaters to work with

	to use GDKRGB when available - results in improved
	speed and stability.

	* app/session.c

	GTK.  Sven will have to look at this fix, but it seems
	to work.

	* plug-ins/gee/gee.c: About eight times faster with

	* app/ink.c
	* app/paint_core.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: Now the perfect-mouse-tracking
	normally enabled by pressing MOD1 is a preferences option,
	and MOD1 inverts the affect.

	* app/ink.c: Mildly tweaked the default brush size/range for
	my own twisted sense of esthetics.  Forgive me.

Sat Jul 18 19:28:53 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: cosmetic change

	* app/convert.c: Minor textual changes.

Fri Jul 17 01:28:30 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	stuff from the output

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: make gimp_image_flatten return a value
	to be consistent with the PDB

Thu Jul 16 13:13:23 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpfeatures.h.in: added features header

Mon Jul 13 22:49:15 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: check for inline by ourselves if it's not
	defined in glibconfig.h. So inline works if glib is compiled
	with a different compiler than gimp. The plug-ins that use
	inline #include "config.h" now (blur, destripe, emboss,
	gfli, nlfilt, ps, randomize, sinus, and zealouscrop)

	* app/main.c: applied gimp-kc-980707-0; fixes command line
	parsing

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/dbbrowser_utils.c: searching by name does
	- <-> _ translation

	* Added filter pack plugin

Mon Jul 13 22:00:31 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.c : argh, s/snprintf/g_snprintf

	  app/layers_dialog.c: applied gimp-kc-980707-1 from
	  Kevin Cozens <kcozens@interlog.com>

	* Dialog boxes for creating a new image or a new layer now include
	  as a fill type option.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/3dTruchet.scm
	 plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/flatland.scm
	 plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/truchet.scm:
	updated these scripts to return the display they open,
	mainly so i can use them in another script

Mon Jul 13 17:48:21 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.[ch]: applied gimp-chap-980709-0
	from  Chap Lovejoy  (chap@cc.gatech.edu)

	From the README:

	Adds fixed size and fixed ratio rectangular selections to the
	gimp.

	Fixed size is enabled by filling in the height and width boxes in
	the rectangular selection tool options box and checking the
	"fixed size" checkbox.

	Fixed ratio is enabled by enabling fixed size (set the height and
	width to the desired ratio values) and holding shift after
	starting the selection (holding shift while starting the selection
	will change the selection operation to add).

Mon Jul 13 07:42:36 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: July 6th's patch from Yasuhiro SHIRASAKI for
	constraining custom-palette choices to <=256 colours broke
	the automatic defaulting of 'Web' palette.  Fixed.

Sun Jul 12 23:56:35 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_swap.c: #if 0'd some of mkj's last commit because it's
	busted.

	* app/tile_swap.c
	* app/tile_swap.h
	* app/tile_manager.c
	* app/tile_manager.h
	* app/pixel_region.c
	* app/pixel_region.h: asynchronous swapin on systems with
	pthreads.  This version is not at all tuned, and the only
	interface which makes use of it now is
	pixel_region_{g,s}et_{row,col}.  Other functions which
	know ahead of time the area that they will be needing can
	request that it be asynchronously swapped in via the
	pixel_region_get_async() function.

Sun Jul 12 17:32:24 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_cache.c: Some optimizations and bugfixes relative to

	* gimplist{.c,.h,F.h,P.h}
	New class for lists

	* gimpbrushlist.h gimpbrushlistF.h gimpbrushlistP.h brush_select.c
	split gimpbrushlist.h into 3 files.  Made gimplist
	the parent class of GimpBrushList.

	* gimpbrushlist.c: brushes in the list are once again sorted by name.

	* paint_funcs.c: minor speed tweak to a minor speed tweak in
	border_region

	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/session.h
	* app/tools.c: More session-managment functionality. Opened dialogs
	are saved and eventually reopened. Try to use the --restore-session
	command-line option. The format of gimprc and sessionrc have
	slightly changed. You should remove your sessionrc and delete the
	line (save-window-positions-on-exit) from your gimprc to avoid
	warnings.

Sat Jul 11 12:20:50 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_manager.c: Removed #include <stdio.h>

Sat Jul 11 08:58:49 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/paint_core.c (paint_core_get_orig_image): Fixed a really
	dumb bug.  (This may solve some of the undo-related crashes.)

1998-07-11  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c:
 	* app/gimprc.c:
	Added commandline for alternate systemwide gimprc.  Fixed alternate
	gimprc (guess I should have tested a little more).

1998-07-10  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c:
	* app/gimprc.c:
	Added commandline support for an alternate gimprc.

	crashing with Scott's new tile scheme.

	* app/tile_manager.c:
	Added some sanity warnings.

	* app/xcf.c:
	Fixed copy-on-write tile loading which was causing crashes
	with Scott's new tile scheme.  Ref balance count seems funny
	still.

1998-07-10  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/docindexif.c: New file.
	* app/docindexif.h: New file.
	* app/docindex.h:
	* app/docindex.c: Lots of changes.  Added docindexif.c and
	docindexif.h as an interface between the document index and the
	application.  This way the document index can be used in two
	applications and updated in both at the same time.  Also, made the
	document index save files even if it's not shown on the screen.

	* app/Makefile.am (gimp_SOURCES): Added docindexif.c and docindexif.h.

Fri Jul 10 01:44:29 PDT 1998 Jay Cox <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* paint_core.c paint_core.h gimpbrushlist.h gimpbrushlist.c

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c app/gimpbrushlist.h
	  the New files replace the functionality of brushes.[ch]
	  and objectify the brushes.  The basic structure is in

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/menus.c (toolbox_entries): Made it so that you won't get two
	document indexes open at the same time.  (docindex.c assumes that
	you only have one open.)

	* app/docindex.h: Added a function to close the document index
	from outside docindex.c.

	* app/docindex.c: Got rid of warnings about isspace().
	(create_idea_toolbar): Got rid of the warnings about pixmaps.
	(close_idea_window): Added a function to close the document index
	from outside docindex.c.
	(idea_hide_callback): Made this function work correctly if called
	when ideas is NULL.

	* app/app_procs.c (really_quit_callback):
	(app_exit): Made it so that the document index saves even if you
	quit without closing it.

	* app/fileops.c (file_save): Made Save As add to the document index.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

 	* pixel_region.c plug_in.c tile.c tile.h tile_cache.c tile_manager.c
 	* tile_swap.c transform_core.c undo.c xcf.c: split off tile_pvt.h
	from tile.h so changes in the tile implementation don't force a
	complete recompile.

Wed Jul  8 01:35:22 EEST 1998  Lauri Alanko <nether@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c (app_exit_finish): Unregister pdb procs _before_

	since the code doesn't handle it (from Yasuhiro SHIRASAKI)

Mon Jul  6 13:18:12 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* pixmaps.h pixmaps2.h tools.c: splits pixmaps up into two headers
	* tile.c: fixed a doublelock deadlock

Sun Jul  5 15:49:02 EDT 1998  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* applied a patch from Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>
	* app/convert.c:  Sucked the warning about
	quantizing to too many colours into a text
	widget embedded in the dialog, improved intelligence of
	dialog to default 'custom palette' selection to 'Web'
 	if available, and in this case not bother to present
	the native WWW-palette radio button. [Adam]

Sat Jul  4 22:58:23 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/autostretch_hsv/autostretch_hsv.c: corrected progress
	display caption

	* app/layer.c
	* app/channel.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gimprc.c: some code cleanups

Thu Jul  2 18:10:43 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	nothing seems to be broken, but I guarantee nothing.

Thu Jul  2 11:03:12 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* updated blur, randomize, and exchange plugins (not sure if
	they should go into stable, they break PDB interfaces)

	* app/Makefile.am:
	* app/gimpset(.c|[FP]?.h):

	return args associated with it's own proc

Tue Jun 30 12:19:58 CDT 1998 arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx

	* pupi-button.scm: (script-fu-round-button) A new beveled button

	* app/transform_core.c:
	* app/xcf.c:

	Isolated the id system of images entirely within pdb. Even the
	window titles and menus use pointers instead of ids. Should at
	least remind people that this is a developers' version. :)

	Misc cleaning up here and there. Note that since the ids were used
 	to detect if an image still exists, some things may, for now,
 	access freed images and break. This will be fixed once proper
 	destroy handlers are added.

Sun Jun 28 19:32:06 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_swap.c: Added a mutex on the swapfile to avoid a

	Removed most of the image id system. They're still used with pdb.
	At quick glance, nothing seems to be broken, but if things weird
	out, blame me.

	Now just the same for layers, channels and displays...

	* app/layer.c (gimp_layer_mask_get_type):
	(gimp_layer_get_type):
	* app/drawable.c (gimp_drawable_get_type):

	provide GIMP_TYPE_* and GIMP_IS_*_CLASS() macros.

Sat Jun 27 23:28:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: minor unused variable warning cleanup

	* plug-ins/bumpmap/bumpmap.c: another warning cleanup

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c: time(NULL) instead of time(0)

	* plug-ins/gpc/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/megawidget/Makefile.am: install in $libdir instead
	of $gimpplugindir since they *are* libs. Some archs try to
	exec them, and it barfs

Sun Jun 28 00:23:52 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/tile.c : fix from Scott Goehring for a thread deadlock

Fri Jun 26 17:22:00 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.[ch]
	* app/procedural_db.c: add procedural_db_get_data_size and

Fri Jun 26 11:00:35 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts.c: define DIVIDE here too (auf,
	script-fu sucks)

	* plug-ins/illusion/illusion.c: parse gtkrc

Fri Jun 26 00:59:16 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am: corrected typo

	* app/rect_select.[ch]: merged in bezier extend patch
	by Raphael FRANCOIS (fraph@ibm.net)

	* app/menus.c: restored "lost" menu items and shortcuts
	These really aren't tools.. maybe they should go somewhere
	else?

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c: added gimp_displays_flush

Thu Jun 25 17:25:01 PDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am:
	* app/app_procs.c:
	* gimp1_1_splash.ppm: Some cosmetic changes to
	better reflect the development stage of gimp.

Tue Jun 23 22:26:09 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: compile everything with -D_REENTRANT

	* app/menus.c: fix for default accel (wrong X char)

	* libgimp/gimpenums.h: make DIVIDE_MODE visible

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c: make it less verbose again

Wed Jun 24 00:45:01 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.in
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/tips_dialog.c: Moved the (last-tip-shown xx) entry to
	sessionrc. You might want to delete that line from your gimprc,
	but it works fine without doing so.

Tue Jun 23 23:21:16 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/menus.c: The lc-dialog can now be opened from the
	toolbox-menu. Did that in preparation for auto-opening dialogs on
	start-up.

Mon Jun 22 22:57:00 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* app/eraser.c:  Ack, try to get pressure sensitivity right this time.

Mon Jun 22 22:57:00 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* app/eraser.c:  Added support for pressure sensitive eraser

Mon Jun 22 23:35:52 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/pixmaps.h: Made a new pixmap for the ink tool that fits
	better to the others.

Mon Jun 22 18:43:22 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am

	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.[ch]  (new files)
	* app/tools.c: Rough outline of session-managment. A new config
	file 'sessionrc' is written and the position of some windows is
	remembered. Still has some problems (offset by wm decorations).
	Can be switched off in the preferences.

Sun Jun 21 15:16:46 CDT 1998 Larry Ewing <lewing@gimp.org>

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/commands.[ch]
	* app/devices.c
	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/pixmaps.h
	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/undo.c: Lots of changes to the way tools are intialized and
	accessed.  All information about a tool type is now contained in a
	single ToolInfo array.  There are still some small issues to
	adress about tool groups and we need some way of getting menu
	ordering/grouping to work better (plug-ins need this too).  There
	is still much to be done, but this is the next in cleaning up the
	tools.

	* app/posterize.[ch]
	* app/threshold.[ch]
	* app/histogram_tool.[ch]
	* app/hue_saturation.[ch]
	* app/levels.[ch]
	* app/brightness_contrast.[ch]
	* app/by_color_select.[ch]
	* app/color_balance.[ch]
	* app/curves.[ch]: Changed the *_initalize function prototypes from
	gpointer to GDisplay, to allow better type chacking and provide a
	uniform interface for all the dialog tools.

Sun Jun 21 15:49:43 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/tools.c (tools_select): Set active_tool before
	updating device status dialog.

	* gimptool.in: fixes for new library versioning

Sat Jun 20 11:36:16 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am: really add thread support

Sat Jun 20 12:04:41 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile.h: #include config.h so we can tell if we're doing
	threads.  (GIMP's includes are f*ck*d.)

	* app/tile_cache.c app/tile.c app/tile.h app/tile_swap.c: modified
	tile swapping to preswap dirty tiles, using a thread if threads
	are enabled in configure or a gtk_timeout if they're not.  The
	code appears stable but could use improvement.  Be careful when
	working in here; there are four sets of semaphores and getting the
	locking wrong will cause deadlocks or tile corruption.  I'll try
	to write up a document describing what's going on in here sometime
	soon.

Fri Jun 19 16:37:40 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	changes for that

Thu Jun 18 23:11:36 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/ink.c: Shift the range to smaller brushes.
	(1/8 - 25 pixel radius, instead of 1-100 pixels)

Thu Jun 18 18:34:58 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h
	* config.h.in
	* configure.in: added --with-threads (taken from gtk+ configure.in)

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: ugly hack to force libgimpi.a to get
	rebuilt since libgimp.la compilations screws up the deps. Fixes
	relinking on make install.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: other cleanups

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug_in.c: pass INT32 instead of INT8 for gdisp_id since
	that's the correct type

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c
	* plug-ins/tileit/tileit.c: warning fixups

Thu Jun 18 21:20:12 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

Thu Jun 18 21:03:33 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/interface.c (create_display_shell): Set the resize
	mode on the statusbar to prevent the window from being
	unnecessarily auto-shrunk.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c (my_gtk_label_set): Removed unused
	function using deprecated gtk_container_need_resize()

Thu Jun 18 16:31:16 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.c: Try to prevent overflows when drawing ellipses)
	(fixes the ink => line bug for big sizes)

	* channels_dialog.c
	* layers_dialog.c: the middle mouse button now pops up the menu
	as well as the third when clicking on the layer/channel. This should
	help users that use a tablet and don't have a right mouse button.

Wed Jun 17 17:47:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: fixed a bug I introduced with the
	new mem_size_unit for the tile_cache_size

	* app/paint_funcs.c
	* app/paint_funcs.h: applied a patch from Jay Cox.
	Reimplements selection_grow, selection_shrink, and selection_border
	using new algorithms.

Wed Jun 17 12:07:44 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.c: default "save_window_positions_on_exit" to FALSE
	until I know why gdk_window_get_position() doesn't work properly
	when the window was never moved

Wed Jun 17 01:56:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: started to implement some sort of
	session-managment; right now it only saves a few window-positions.

	tile_cache_size entry. Added spinbuttons where appropriate (used
	parts of the patch Nuke <nuke@bayside.net> sent to the list).

Sun Jun 15 00:41:05 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: Table spacings

Sun Jun 14 23:41:17 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in.c: Fixed progress code to account for when
	a plugin gets two progress inits

	* app/interface.c: Fixed table allocation sickness.  Now use
	two tables, and a vbox instead of one table so things don't
	get expanded when they shouldn't.  This (table/table_inner)
	should be merged back to 1.0 tree.  The other resize bug is a
	gtkstatusbar bug.

	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/plug_in.h
	* libgimp/gimp.c: added statusbar and progressbar, which
	the plugins now use if they have a gdisp.  Unfortunately

	* app/blob.[ch] (blob_bounds): Added new files for
	handling scan-converted convex polygons. (From
	gsumi) (these will be moved out to a plug-in tool directory
	when such a thing exists)

	* app/ink.[ch]: New tool for drawing with a hard-edged
	pressure and tilt-sensitive brush.

Sun Jun 14 16:03:29 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* TODO: cleaned up and expanded the todo

Sun Jun 14 00:50:25 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	parsing

	now uses spinbuttons. I'm still not sure this change is
	for the better, let me know. Pretty heavily based
	on a patch by Nuke Skyjumper <nuke@bayside.net>

Fri Jun 12 14:17:54 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*app/file_new_dialog.c
	app/file_new_dialog.h:
	app/gloal_edit.c:  added behaviour so that the
	new file size will default to the current cut buffer
	if its "fresh"

Thu Jun 11 23:37:06 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimp.m4: .m4 file for autoconf gimptool stuff

	* app/interface.c (create_toolbox): Create the color
	area before showing the window, so that the window gets
	created at the right size. [ This doesn't actually fix
	much, but it is better to do that way ]

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_origin_button_press):
	Stop signal emission so that button doesn't grab the

	* app/interface.c: changed GDK_IMAGE_NORMAL to GDK_IMAGE_SHARED
	to workaround gtk bug

Fri Jun  5 22:37:40 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/Makefile.am app/app_procs.c app/brushes.c app/commands.[ch]
	  app/disp_callbacks.c app/gdisplay.[ch] app/gimprc.c
	  app/interface.[ch] app/menus.c app/paint_core.[ch]
	  app/paintbrush.c app/palette.c app/scroll.c
	  app/tools.[ch] app/undo.c

	- Added two new dialogs - input devices; (GtkInputDialog)
	  and DeviceStatus - which shows the tool/color for
	  each device.

	- Added device_status_update() call that gets called
	  whenever the tool/color etc. are changed.

	- Added ~/.gimp/devicerc file to store settings

	- Code to draw cursor on canvas for non XFree86 XInput
	  where device can't control cursor and extended input
	  device simultaneously.

	- Changed input handling so that we always use the pointer
	  position from the device, not from gdk_input_window_get_cursor,
	  so that motion and cursor position sync.

	- Various changes so things work with non-integer coordinates

	- Pay attention to pressure and tilt in basic tool support.

	- New paint mode PRESSURE that changes the brush based on
	  the brush pressure

	- Left in a few XInput hacks that should be removed, but I no longer
	  remember what they are.
