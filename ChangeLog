	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/asc2img.scm: removed this script as it
	is broken beyond repair and the functionality is provided by the
	text tool itself.

	* NEWS: added NEWS for the stable branch (no, we haven't branched
	yet).

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (blur_line): fixed the degenerate case
	where the source image is smaller than the blurred area. This used
	to give artefacts at the borders.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: more code cleanup and micro
	optimizations.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <neumann@jpk.com>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: reverted the last change since it
	introduced artefacts. Even had to increase the border around the
	previewed area. Fixed a bug in unsharp_region() where it was using
	the wrong source region for blurring.

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: compute preview for the displayed area
	only, some more code cleanup.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (preview_update): fixed bug #157910.
	More code cleanup and some trivial optimizations.

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	(gradient_editor_actions_update): if the dialog is insensitive,
	disable all actions which modify the gradient. Fixes bug #161411.

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-commands.c: update the UI manager
	after setting the dialog sensitive/insensitive so te above works.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.0 release.
