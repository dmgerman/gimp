	--quiet and -n options

	* gimp.m4: set NOUI stuff if available

Thu Jul 16 16:20:47 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.in: Added --cflags-noui and --libs-noui flags and
	appropriate sed junk to craft it. Don't call gtk-config unless
	GTK_CONFIG is set; hard code the info. Strip out redundant
	stuff from the output

	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpimage.c: make gimp_image_flatten return a value
	to be consistent with the PDB

Thu Jul 16 13:13:23 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* updated MapObject again

Thu Jul 16 04:38:19 PDT 1998 Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

Mon Jul 13 22:49:15 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: check for inline by ourselves if it's not
	defined in glibconfig.h. So inline works if glib is compiled
	with a different compiler than gimp. The plug-ins that use
	inline #include "config.h" now (blur, destripe, emboss,
	gfli, nlfilt, ps, randomize, sinus, and zealouscrop)

	* app/main.c: applied gimp-kc-980707-0; fixes command line
	parsing

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/dbbrowser_utils.c: searching by name does
	- <-> _ translation

	* Added filter pack plugin

Mon Jul 13 22:00:31 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>
	
	* app/rect_select.c : argh, s/snprintf/g_snprintf

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/3dTruchet.scm
	 plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/flatland.scm
	 plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/truchet.scm:
	updated these scripts to return the display they open,
	mainly so i can use them in another script

Mon Jul 13 17:48:21 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/rect_select.[ch]: applied gimp-chap-980709-0
	from  Chap Lovejoy  (chap@cc.gatech.edu)

	From the README:

	Adds fixed size and fixed ratio rectangular selections to the 
	gimp.

        Fixed size is enabled by filling in the height and width boxes in 
        the rectangular selection tool options box and checking the 
        "fixed size" checkbox.

        Fixed ratio is enabled by enabling fixed size (set the height and
        width to the desired ratio values) and holding shift after
	starting the selection (holding shift while starting the selection
	will change the selection operation to add).

Tue Jul 14 00:26:49 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c
	* app/menus.c

Mon Jul 13 07:42:36 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: July 6th's patch from Yasuhiro SHIRASAKI for
	constraining custom-palette choices to <=256 colours broke
	the automatic defaulting of 'Web' palette.  Fixed.

Sun Jul 12 23:56:35 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_swap.c: #if 0'd some of mkj's last commit because it's
	busted.

Sun Jul 12 19:00:15 EDT 1998 Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com>

	* app/tile_swap.c
	* app/tile_swap.h
	* app/tile_manager.c
	* app/tile_manager.h
	* app/pixel_region.c
	* app/pixel_region.h: asynchronous swapin on systems with
	pthreads.  This version is not at all tuned, and the only
	interface which makes use of it now is
	pixel_region_{g,s}et_{row,col}.  Other functions which
	know ahead of time the area that they will be needing can
	request that it be asynchronously swapped in via the
	pixel_region_get_async() function.

Sun Jul 12 17:32:24 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_cache.c: Some optimizations and bugfixes relative to
 	the preswapper.

Sun Jul 12 15:56:01 BST 1998 Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/interface.c

	plugin when the progress-bar has been sucked into the image
	window.

	* plug-ins/psd/psd.c: Turned debugging on again, since we
	are in a development cycle...

Sun Jul 12 04:16:17 PDT 1998 Jay Cox <jaycox@earthlink.net>

        New class for lists

	* gimpbrushlist.h gimpbrushlistF.h gimpbrushlistP.h brush_select.c
        split gimpbrushlist.h into 3 files.  Made gimplist
        the parent class of GimpBrushList.

	* gimpbrushlist.c: brushes in the list are once again sorted by name.

	* paint_funcs.c: minor speed tweak to a minor speed tweak in 
	border_region

Sat Jul 11 22:15:31 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/ink.c (tools_free_ink): Free last_blob when destroying
	  tool.

	* app/blob.c: Fix off-by-one error when searhing for gaps.

	be a bit less aggressive.

Sun Jul 12 00:44:57 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	lewing pointed out that you can't make them smaller any more :-(

Sun Jul 12 00:13:02 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimprc.in
	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/appenv.h

	* app/pattern_select.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/session.h
	* app/tools.c: More session-managment functionality. Opened dialogs
	are saved and eventually reopened. Try to use the --restore-session
	command-line option. The format of gimprc and sessionrc have
        slightly changed. You should remove your sessionrc and delete the
	line (save-window-positions-on-exit) from your gimprc to avoid
	warnings.

Sat Jul 11 12:20:50 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_manager.c: Removed #include <stdio.h>

Sat Jul 11 08:58:49 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/paint_core.c (paint_core_get_orig_image): Fixed a really
	dumb bug.  (This may solve some of the undo-related crashes.)

1998-07-11  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c:
 	* app/gimprc.c:
	Added commandline for alternate systemwide gimprc.  Fixed alternate
	gimprc (guess I should have tested a little more).

1998-07-10  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	Fixed copy-on-write path of copy_region which was sometimes
	crashing with Scott's new tile scheme.

	* app/tile_manager.c:
	Added some sanity warnings.

	* app/xcf.c:
	Fixed copy-on-write tile loading which was causing crashes
	with Scott's new tile scheme.  Ref balance count seems funny
	still.

1998-07-10  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/docindexif.c: New file.
	* app/docindexif.h: New file.
	* app/docindex.h: 
	* app/docindex.c: Lots of changes.  Added docindexif.c and
	docindexif.h as an interface between the document index and the
	application.  This way the document index can be used in two
	applications and updated in both at the same time.  Also, made the
	document index save files even if it's not shown on the screen.

	* app/Makefile.am (gimp_SOURCES): Added docindexif.c and docindexif.h.

Fri Jul 10 01:44:29 PDT 1998 Jay Cox <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* paint_core.c paint_core.h gimpbrushlist.h gimpbrushlist.c

	  clone source hasn't been selected or no longer exists.

Wed Jul  8 21:34:31 PDT 1998  Jay Cox <jaycox@earthlink.net>

        * app/brushes.c app/brushes.h:  removed files

        * app/gimpbrush.c app/gimpbrush.h
        * app/gimpbrushlist.c app/gimpbrushlist.h
          the New files replace the functionality of brushes.[ch]

        * app/gimpbrushgenerated.c app/gimpbrushgenerated.h
          New type of brush that is can be modified on the fly

        * brush_edit.c brush_edit.h

          brush_select.h brush_edit.h preferences_dialog.c pencil.c
          paintbrush.c internal_procs.c gimage_mask.c eraser.c convolve.c
          commands.c colormaps.c airbrush.c clone.c app_procs.c
          paint_core.h
          Minor changes to support above new functionality.

	with an iteration over gimages.

	* app/layer.c: added an assert to check for gimage != NULL.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* app/menus.c (toolbox_entries): Made it so that you won't get two
	document indexes open at the same time.  (docindex.c assumes that
	you only have one open.)

	* app/docindex.h: Added a function to close the document index
	from outside docindex.c.

	* app/docindex.c: Got rid of warnings about isspace().
	(create_idea_toolbar): Got rid of the warnings about pixmaps.

	when ideas is NULL.

	* app/app_procs.c (really_quit_callback):
	(app_exit): Made it so that the document index saves even if you
	quit without closing it.

	* app/fileops.c (file_save): Made Save As add to the document index.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	from tile.h so changes in the tile implementation don't force a
	complete recompile.

Wed Jul  8 01:35:22 EEST 1998  Lauri Alanko <nether@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c (app_exit_finish): Unregister pdb procs _before_ 
	destroying pdb.

	since the code doesn't handle it (from Yasuhiro SHIRASAKI)

Mon Jul  6 13:18:12 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* pixmaps.h pixmaps2.h tools.c: splits pixmaps up into two headers

	* app/convert.c:  Sucked the warning about
	quantizing to too many colours into a text 
        widget embedded in the dialog, improved intelligence of
	dialog to default 'custom palette' selection to 'Web'
 	if available, and in this case not bother to present 
	the native WWW-palette radio button. [Adam]

Sat Jul  4 22:58:23 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/autostretch_hsv/autostretch_hsv.c: corrected progress
	display caption

Sat Jul  4 16:58:43 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	nothing seems to be broken, but I guarantee nothing.

Thu Jul  2 11:03:12 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* updated blur, randomize, and exchange plugins (not sure if
	they should go into stable, they break PDB interfaces)

	Misc cleaning up here and there. Note that since the ids were used
 	to detect if an image still exists, some things may, for now,
 	access freed images and break. This will be fixed once proper
 	destroy handlers are added.
	
Sun Jun 28 19:32:06 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile_swap.c: Added a mutex on the swapfile to avoid a
	potential race condition.

	* app/interface.c: minor unused variable warning cleanup

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c: time(NULL) instead of time(0)

	* plug-ins/gpc/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/megawidget/Makefile.am: install in $libdir instead
	of $gimpplugindir since they *are* libs. Some archs try to
	exec them, and it barfs

Sun Jun 28 00:23:52 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/tile.c : fix from Scott Goehring for a thread deadlock

Fri Jun 26 17:22:00 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c: fix for default accel (wrong X char)

	* libgimp/gimpenums.h: make DIVIDE_MODE visible

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c: make it less verbose again

	* gimprc.in
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* app/session.c
	* app/tips_dialog.c: Moved the (last-tip-shown xx) entry to

	but it works fine without doing so.

Tue Jun 23 23:21:16 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/menus.c: The lc-dialog can now be opened from the
	toolbox-menu. Did that in preparation for auto-opening dialogs on
	start-up.

Mon Jun 22 22:57:00 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

Mon Jun 22 23:35:52 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/pixmaps.h: Made a new pixmap for the ink tool that fits

	* app/tools.c: Rough outline of session-managment. A new config
	file 'sessionrc' is written and the position of some windows is
	remembered. Still has some problems (offset by wm decorations).
	Can be switched off in the preferences.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/menus.c
	* app/pixmaps.h
	* app/tools.[ch]
	* app/undo.c: Lots of changes to the way tools are intialized and
	accessed.  All information about a tool type is now contained in a 
	single ToolInfo array.  There are still some small issues to
	adress about tool groups and we need some way of getting menu
	ordering/grouping to work better (plug-ins need this too).  There
	is still much to be done, but this is the next in cleaning up the
	tools.

	* app/color_balance.[ch]
	* app/curves.[ch]: Changed the *_initalize function prototypes from
	gpointer to GDisplay, to allow better type chacking and provide a 
	uniform interface for all the dialog tools.
		
Sun Jun 21 15:49:43 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/tools.c (tools_select): Set active_tool before

Sat Jun 20 11:36:16 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am: really add thread support

Sat Jun 20 12:04:41 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* app/tile.h: #include config.h so we can tell if we're doing
	threads.  (GIMP's includes are f*ck*d.)

	* app/tile_cache.c app/tile.c app/tile.h app/tile_swap.c: modified
	tile swapping to preswap dirty tiles, using a thread if threads
	are enabled in configure or a gtk_timeout if they're not.  The
	code appears stable but could use improvement.  Be careful when
	working in here; there are four sets of semaphores and getting the
	locking wrong will cause deadlocks or tile corruption.  I'll try
	to write up a document describing what's going on in here sometime
	soon.

Fri Jun 19 16:37:40 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	changes for that

Thu Jun 18 23:11:36 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/ink.c: Shift the range to smaller brushes.
	(1/8 - 25 pixel radius, instead of 1-100 pixels)

Thu Jun 18 18:34:58 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h
	* config.h.in
	* configure.in: added --with-threads (taken from gtk+ configure.in)

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: ugly hack to force libgimpi.a to get
	rebuilt since libgimp.la compilations screws up the deps. Fixes
	relinking on make install.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: other cleanups

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug_in.c: pass INT32 instead of INT8 for gdisp_id since
	that's the correct type

	* app/preferences_dialog.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c
	* plug-ins/tileit/tileit.c: warning fixups

Thu Jun 18 21:20:12 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/interface.c app/tools.c: Removed calls to
	  gtk_container_[dis/en]able_resize()

Thu Jun 18 21:03:33 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/interface.c (create_display_shell): Set the resize
	mode on the statusbar to prevent the window from being
	unnecessarily auto-shrunk.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c (my_gtk_label_set): Removed unused
	function using deprecated gtk_container_need_resize()
	
Thu Jun 18 16:31:16 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.c: Try to prevent overflows when drawing ellipses)
	(fixes the ink => line bug for big sizes)

	making a preference

Thu Jun 18 00:56:41 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* channels_dialog.c
	* layers_dialog.c: the middle mouse button now pops up the menu
	as well as the third when clicking on the layer/channel. This should
	help users that use a tablet and don't have a right mouse button.

Wed Jun 17 17:47:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c: fixed a bug I introduced with the 
	new mem_size_unit for the tile_cache_size 

Wed Jun 17 16:38:40 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.c
	* app/paint_funcs.c
	* app/paint_funcs.h: applied a patch from Jay Cox. 
	Reimplements selection_grow, selection_shrink, and selection_border 
	using new algorithms.

Wed Jun 17 12:07:44 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimprc.c: default "save_window_positions_on_exit" to FALSE
	until I know why gdk_window_get_position() doesn't work properly
	when the window was never moved

Wed Jun 17 01:56:30 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c
	* app/gimprc.c
	* app/gimprc.h
	* app/layers_dialog.c
	* app/interface.c
	* app/preferences_dialog.c: started to implement some sort of
	session-managment; right now it only saves a few window-positions.
	I plan to move the saving out of gimprc into a seperate rcfile

Tue Jun 16 15:06:19 CDT 1998 Larry Ewing <lewing@gimp.org>

	and began small cleanup of tools

Mon Jun 15 12:42:43 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	tile_cache_size entry. Added spinbuttons where appropriate (used
	parts of the patch Nuke <nuke@bayside.net> sent to the list).	

Sun Jun 15 00:41:05 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: Table spacings

Sun Jun 14 23:41:17 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in.c: Fixed progress code to account for when
	a plugin gets two progress inits

	* app/interface.c: Fixed table allocation sickness.  Now use
	two tables, and a vbox instead of one table so things don't
	get expanded when they shouldn't.  This (table/table_inner)
	should be merged back to 1.0 tree.  The other resize bug is a 
	gtkstatusbar bug.

Sun Jun 14 21:16:42 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/interface.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/plug_in.h
	* libgimp/gimp.c: added statusbar and progressbar, which
	the plugins now use if they have a gdisp.  Unfortunately 
	this introduces a resize bug I wasn't able to fix 
	immediately. ;-(

Sun Jun 14 18:37:06 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.[ch] (blob_bounds): Added new files for
	handling scan-converted convex polygons. (From
	gsumi) (these will be moved out to a plug-in tool directory
	when such a thing exists)

	* app/ink.[ch]: New tool for drawing with a hard-edged
	pressure and tilt-sensitive brush.

Sun Jun 14 16:03:29 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>
	
	* TODO: cleaned up and expanded the todo

Sun Jun 14 00:50:25 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gif/gif.c: don't pop up dialog for informational

	* libgimp/gimp.c: make the plugins aware of $gimpdir for gtkrc
	parsing

Sat Jun 13 16:52:34 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	replace a * with a / so it will work
	
Sat Jun 13 15:46:55 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*app/file_new_dialog.c: more file new tweaks,
	now uses spinbuttons. I'm still not sure this change is
	for the better, let me know. Pretty heavily based
	on a patch by Nuke Skyjumper <nuke@bayside.net>

Fri Jun 12 14:17:54 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*app/file_new_dialog.c
	app/file_new_dialog.h:
	app/gloal_edit.c:  added behaviour so that the
	new file size will default to the current cut buffer
	if its "fresh"

Thu Jun 11 23:37:06 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimp.m4: .m4 file for autoconf gimptool stuff

Thu Jun 11 00:34:51 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/color_area.c (color_area_events): Create/resize
	the pixmap on every expose CONFIGURE event, not just
	on the first expose event.

Thu Jun 11 00:02:15 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/interface.c (create_toolbox): Create the color
	area before showing the window, so that the window gets
	created at the right size. [ This doesn't actually fix 
	much, but it is better to do that way ]

Wed Jun 10 14:17:44 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_origin_button_press): 
	Stop signal emission so that button doesn't grab the

Tue Jun  9 16:08:20 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrain@gimp.org>

	*app/file_new_dialog.c: more fiddling with file_new.
	the resoution unit optionmenu should work now. Just
	need to get the optionmenus remembering history.

Tue Jun  9 12:36:57 EDT 1998  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*confiure.in: corrected small type concering jpeg test
	(warning printed out "checking for jpeg.h" instead of	
	jpeglib.h)

Tue Jun  9 04:36:52 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Got rid of a bunch of warnings when compiling plugins

	the image window

	* updated pagecurl plug-in 

Mon Jun  8 21:55:55 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/airbrush.c: Simple pressure sensitivity.

Mon Jun  8 17:47:37 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	them (from timj)

Mon Jun  8 17:16:22 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/color_select.[ch]: added a hex triplet to the color
	selector. It updates on focus_leave for now, so I bet there

	* app/fileops.c: add an #include to quell a warning

Mon Jun  8 16:18:00 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c: fixed param passing for
	INT8 and INT16 types. This used to fail on big endian machines

	* plug-ins/maze/maze.c: properly handle INT8 and INT16 types.
	With these two fixes, circuit.scm will no longer crash on
	big endian machines

Sun Jun  7 00:19:22 EDT 1998  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c: Reworked the file_new dialog to
	be a little more useful. Added entries for a height
	and width in the unit of your choice, and a resolution.
	Not everythings hooked up yet, but its getting there.

Sun Jun  7 00:22:01 EDT 1998  Matthew Wilson  <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/interface.c: Register private tips for all the tools -

Fri Jun  5 22:37:40 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/Makefile.am app/app_procs.c app/brushes.c app/commands.[ch]
	  app/disp_callbacks.c app/gdisplay.[ch] app/gimprc.c
	  app/interface.[ch] app/menus.c app/paint_core.[ch]
	  app/paintbrush.c app/palette.c app/scroll.c
	  app/tools.[ch] app/undo.c

	- Added two new dialogs - input devices; (GtkInputDialog)
	  and DeviceStatus - which shows the tool/color for
	  each device.

	- Added device_status_update() call that gets called
	  whenever the tool/color etc. are changed.

	- Added ~/.gimp/devicerc file to store settings

	- Code to draw cursor on canvas for non XFree86 XInput
	  where device can't control cursor and extended input
	  device simultaneously.

	- Changed input handling so that we always use the pointer
	  position from the device, not from gdk_input_window_get_cursor,
	  so that motion and cursor position sync.

	- Various changes so things work with non-integer coordinates

	- Pay attention to pressure and tilt in basic tool support.

        - New paint mode PRESSURE that changes the brush based on
	  the brush pressure

	- Left in a few XInput hacks that should be removed, but I no longer
	  remember what they are.
