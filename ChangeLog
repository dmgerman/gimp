2008-10-24  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationadditionmode.c: For alpha compositing
	consistency, all layers should affect alpha in the same way
	independent of layer mode. Replace the compositing algorithm with
	a version without the flaws discovered so far in the previous
	ones. Don't use it yet though as it requires premultiplied data.

2008-10-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/scale-region.c (scale): use the inverse of the
	scale factor so that we can multiply instead of dividing in the
	loops.

2008-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: rename GimpStrokeStyle to GimpFillStyle.

	* app/core/gimpfilloptions.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-stroke.c
	(gimp_drawable_stroke_scan_convert): changed accordingly.

2008-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merge a part of SOC 2006's vector layer branch:

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/core-types.h
	* app/core/gimpfilloptions.[ch]: new GimpContext subclass factored
	out of GimpStrokeOptions. Has "style" and "antialias" properties.

	* app/core/gimpstrokeoptions.[ch]: derive from GimpFillOptions
	and remove said properties.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-stroke.c
	(gimp_drawable_stroke_scan_convert): changed accordingly.

2008-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/gimppluginprocframe.c
	(gimp_plug_in_proc_frame_dispose): set proc_frame->procedure to
	NULL *after* calling gimp_plug_in_cleanup(). Fixes the crash on
	windows in bug #557061 (but not the bug).

2008-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.h: don't #include
	"libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h".

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-draw.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c: include it here.

2008-10-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 556896 – Dialogs don't get minimized with single image window

	* app/display/gimpdisplay-foreach.[ch]: added utility function to
	get the number of visible (not withdrawn or iconified) displays.

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: added functions to hide and
	show the dock windows. Changed gimp_dialog_factories_toggle() to
	use the new functions.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	(gimp_display_shell_window_state_event): hide the docks if the
	last display is iconified. Unhide them if a display is
	uniconified. Probably needs more work ...

2008-10-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed check for Carbon and added a test for the
	target OS being Darwin instead.

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.c: use PLATFORM_OSX instead of
	HAVE_CARBON to determine the default "web-browser" command.

2008-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/print/print-preview.c (print_preview_leave_notify_event):
	check the crossing mode and don't unset the "inside" flag when the
	event is caused by a pointer grab/ungrab.

2008-10-22  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Bug 556804 – Zoom drop down doesn't update

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: Fix calls to
	gimp_display_shell_scaled() when Resize window on zoom is enabled.

2008-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 524615 – Print not to scale

	* plug-ins/print/print.c: set the unit for dimensions on the Cairo
	context used for printing to GTK_UNIT_PIXELS.

	* plug-ins/print/print-draw-page.c (print_draw_page): changed the
	Cairo scale factors accordingly. Seems to fix printing on Windows.

2008-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpprogressbox.c: set box->progress to NULL in
	destroy() and check for progress being NULL in various places so
	we don't crash on API calls after the widget is destroyed.

2008-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 555246 – gimp crashes when a file is opened while a preview is
	generating

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: set box->progress to NULL in
	destroy() and check for progress being NULL in various places so
	we don't crash on API calls after the widget is destroyed.

2008-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 556741 – Alpha layer automatically added (in psd format) but
	not desired

	* plug-ins/file-psd/psd-save.c: applied patch from Dennis Ranke
	that flattens the projection for indexed images.

2008-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c
	* app/plug-in/gimpplugin-progress.c: formatting.

2008-10-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 555246 – gimp crashes when a file is opened while a preview is
	generating

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c: set dialog->progress to NULL in
	destroy() and check for progress being NULL in various places so
	we don't crash on API calls after the widget is destroyed.

2008-10-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpgegltool.c (gimp_param_spec_duplicate):
	GEGL_IS_PARAM_SPEC_PATH() became GEGL_IS_PARAM_SPEC_FILE_PATH()
	in GEGL 0.0.21.

2008-10-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpgegltool.c (gimp_gegl_tool_dialog): for the
	combo-box, strip known prefixes from the GEGL operation names and
	use icons instead.

2008-10-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-commands.c (file_open_recent_cmd_callback): ref
	the GimpDisplay and GimpImageFile objects while holding a
	reference to them. Fixes a potential crash if GIMP is closed while
	the image is being loaded.

2008-10-20  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* app/actions/debug-actions.c
	* app/actions/debug-commands.c: Create dump and non-dump
	groups. Also added a tooltip to the Benchmark Projection action
	and removed report of number of layers.

2008-10-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimperrorconsole.c (gimp_error_console_init): don't
	make the font size even smaller. We already use a smaller font in
	the dock windows.

2008-10-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c (view_events) (control_events):
	use pointer coordinates from the passed event instead of calling
	gtk_widget_get_pointer().

2008-10-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bump-map.c (dialog_preview_events): use pointer
	coordinates from the passed event instead of calling
	gtk_widget_get_pointer().

2008-10-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/iwarp.c: set the OK and Reset button insensitive
	until the user has defined a deformation to apply. Cleaned up
	event handling.

2008-10-20  David Odin  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/*.c: untabified

	other minor cleanups.

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationadditionmode.c: Remove local channel
	offset defines.

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperation*mode.c: Refer to the input as 'in'
	instead of 'src', the layer as 'layer' instead of 'aux', and the
	result as 'out' instead of 'dest'.

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/base/base-types.h: Rename the convenient channel offset
	defines from CHANNEL_PIX to CHANNEL as this increases readability.

	* app/base/color-balance.c
	* app/base/colorize.c
	* app/base/desaturate.c
	* app/base/hue-saturation.c
	* app/base/siox.c

2008-10-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 493778 – metadata plug-in crashes on some images

	* plug-ins/metadata/xmp-encode.c (gen_property): introduced a
	utility function to create XML elements. Deal gracefully with NULL
	and empty values. Does not fix the crash, but fixes a warning that
	has been reported in the same bug report.

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/base/base-types.h: There is nothing magic or ugly about the
	convenient defines, remove comments saying so.

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationadditionmode.c: Refer to the input as 'in'
	instead of 'src', the layer as 'layer' instead of 'aux', and the
	result as 'out' instead of 'dest'. The old terminology clashes
	with at least the SVG 1.2 compositing terminology [1] and there is
	no reason for creating confusion.

	[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/rendering.html

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationadditionmode.c: Use local variants of
	channel offset defines, namely RED instead of RED_PIX etc, to
	increase readability.

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/actions/debug-commands.c
	(debug_dump_projection_benchmarking_cmd_callback): In addition to
	priting how long it takes to validate the projection, also print
	the number of layers in the image.

2008-10-19  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* app/actions/debug-actions.c
	* app/actions/debug-commands.[ch]: Added a 'Dump Projection
	Benchmarking' item to the Debug Menu so that we can test how
	different GEGL graph setups affect performance.

2008-10-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: add -Wmissing-format-attribute to CFLAGS.

	* app/core/gimpcoords-interpolate.[ch]: new files with
	interpolation code taken from ...

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c: ... here.

	* app/Makefile.am (AM_LDFLAGS): make it link.

2008-10-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/file-psd/psd-save.c (xfwrite): fixed handling of empty
	strings. Don't quit silently, write an error message to stderr at
	least.

2008-10-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp.[ch]: added signal Gimp::image-opened to announce
	that an image has been loaded and a display was created for it.

	* app/file/file-open.c (file_open_with_proc_and_display): call
	gimp_image_opened() to emit the new signal.

	* app/gui/dbus-service.xml
	* app/gui/gimpdbusservice.[ch]: propagate the 'opened' signal to
	listeners of the "org.gimp.GIMP.UI" DBus service.

	* app/gui/gui-unique.c: formatting.

2008-10-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderervectors.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_vectors_draw): just some cleanup.

2008-10-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 556248 – Scaling gives 'jagged' edges

	* app/paint-funcs/scale-region.c (scale): calculate pixel
	contributions based on pixel centers, not on pixel origins.

2008-10-15  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@gimp.org>

	* themes/Default/images/stock-gegl.svg:
	* themes/Default/images/stock-gegl-22.svg:
	* themes/Default/images/stock-gegl-22.png: remove white from the
	shadow to render correctly on dark backgrounds.

2008-10-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb.pl: reindent the list of PDB types and remove
	the unused and deprecated types "boundary" and "region". Also
	remove "status" because it is unused (and unneeded and
	unimplemented).

2008-10-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpgegltool.c (gimp_gegl_tool_operation_blacklisted):
	add the gegl: prefix here too.

	(gimp_gegl_tool_get_config): canonicalize the type name of the
	created config class or we crash.

2008-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/sanity.c: require GEGL >= 0.0.21.

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-brightness-contrast.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-invert.c
	* app/core/gimpimage.c
	* app/core/gimpimagemap.c
	* app/core/gimplayer.c
	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl-utils.c
	* app/tools/gimpbrightnesscontrasttool.c: GEGL operation names
	are now "gegl:"-prefixed.

	* app/core/gimpimagemap.c: set the node's "dont-cache" property
	unconditionally.

2008-10-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.c (gimp_dialog_factory_add_dialog):
	let new docks appear at the pointer position.

2008-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]: add a default implementation of
	GimpDrawable::get_node() which contains a layer mode node.
	Implement GimpItem::visibility_changed() and turn the node into a
	nop when the drawable is invisible. Added public function
	gimp_drawable_get_mode_node() so subclasses can plug stuff
	into its "aux" pad.

	* app/core/gimplayer.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpchannel.[ch]: changed accordingly (remove
	duplicated member and code that is now in GimpDrawable).

2008-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl-utils.[ch]: remove function
	gimp_bpp_to_babl_format_linear() and add "gboolean linear"
	parameter to gimp_bpp_to_babl_format().

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationtilesink.c (process)
	* app/gegl/gimpoperationtilesource.c (prepare): simply pass
	self->linear to above changed function instead of selecting
	between the two old functions.

2008-10-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/signals.c (gimp_init_signal_handlers): comments.

2008-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 556182 – Could you please explain a few strings [I18N]

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/py-slice.py: added translator comments.

2008-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/signals.[ch]: new files with code split out of main.c.

	* app/main.c: changed accordingly.

2008-10-13  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationadditionmode.c
	(gimp_operation_addition_mode_process): Update with a new version
	that is the best known so far (maybe it's even correct?).

2008-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 547967 – Improve app/paint-funcs/ maintainability

	Applied patch from Luidnel Maignan that splits the legacy code for
	layer modes into new files.

	* app/paint-funcs/Makefile.am
	* app/paint-funcs/layer-modes.[ch]
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-utils.h: new files with code taken
	from ...

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-generic.h
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.c: ... these two files.

2008-10-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl-utils.c (gimp_layer_mode_to_gegl_operation):
	remove warning because the missing layer modes are now
	"implemented", ha ha.

2008-10-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationpointcomposer.[ch]: renamed this class...

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationlayermode.[ch]: ...to this and add
	an own process() virtual function so we are free to hack even
	more badly in order to support legacy layer modes and proper
	ones which do meaningful things to alpha. Simply redirect
	GeglOperationPointComposer's compose() calls to our own vfunc
	for now.

	* app/gegl/gegl-types.h
	* app/gegl/Makefile.am: changed accordingly.

	* app/gegl/gimpoperation*mode.[ch]: changed parent class and
	implemented process() method accordingly.

2008-10-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationadditionmode.c: commit some #if 0'ed
	experimental code.

	* app/actions/view-commands.c (view_use_gegl_cmd_callback): use
	gimp_image_update(), simply exposing the shell doesn't reconstruct
	the projection.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpprojection.h: add a "use_gegl" boolean member.

	* app/core/gimpprojection-construct.c (gimp_projection_construct):
	use the boolean instead of hardcoding FALSE.

	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: add a "Use GEGL" action and
	callback which sets the boolean and exposes the display.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: add it to the "View" menu.

2008-10-11  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationadditionmode.c
	(gimp_operation_addition_mode_process): Implement this one.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl-utils.c (gimp_layer_mode_to_gegl_operation):
	it's gimp-screen-node not gimp-screen_mode.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationpointcomposer.[ch]: add an empty abstract
	GeglOperationPointComposer subclass which can be used to hook in
	common debug or test or whatever code for below layer modes.

	* app/gegl/gimpoperation*mode.[ch]: add empty stubs of layer mode
	operations which do nothing but copying input to output.

	* app/gegl/Makefile.am
	* app/gegl/gegl-types.h: add them here and reordered things a bit.

	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl.c (gimp_gegl_init): register the new
	operations.

	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl-utils.c (gimp_layer_mode_to_gegl_operation):
	return the new operations.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpoperationpointfilter.c: make it abstract.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl-utils.c (gimp_layer_mode_to_gegl_operation):
	don't return non-existing layer modes (in fact, return "normal"
	for all modes).

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpchannel.[ch]: add a projection node and
	implement GimpDrawable::get_node(). Reconfigure the node in
	visibility_changed(), set_color(), set_opacity() and
	set_show_masked().

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_get_graph): enable code that
	projects the channels stack on top of the layer stack.

	* app/core/gimpprojection-construct.c: remove the call to
	gimp_projection_construct_channels() from the GEGL code path. Also
	don't touch proj->construct_flag.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_get_node): remove obsolete
	assertion and redundant cast.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawablestack.c: add GimpContainer::add()
	implementation, it's needed after all even though everybody uses
	gimp_container_insert() on drawable stacks.

	(gimp_drawable_stack_remove_node): no need to have a special check
	for newly added nodes, this can't happen any more now that we have
	an add() impl.

	(gimp_drawable_stack_get_graph): free the reverse list.

2008-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fix old bug in the GimpContainer implementation that wasn't
	visible before the drawable stack completly b0rked when removing
	the second-last item:

	* app/core/gimpcontainer.c: add default implementations of ::add()
	and ::remove() and update container->num_children there instead of
	in the gimp_container_add() and _remove() wrapper functions.
	This way not only external callbacks connected to the "add" and
	"remove" signals are called with the correct num_children, also
	implemtations of ::add() and ::remove() in subclass have the right
	number available before/after upchaining. Add paranoia code to the
	wrapper functions which check if the subclass reall chains up.

	* app/core/gimplist.c: chain up in add() and remove().

2008-10-11  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdockseparator.c (gimp_dock_separator_drag_drop):
	Initialize 'index'.

2008-10-11  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdockseparator.c (gimp_dock_separator_new): Add a
	GtkAnchorType member to GimpDockSeparator that specifies where a
	dropped dockable shall be inserted.

	(gimp_dock_separator_drag_drop): Get rid of the ugly hack where
	the role of a given separator was based on its position as a child
	in its container. Simply decide what role the separator has by
	loooking at its anchor-member.

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c (gimp_dock_init)
	(gimp_dock_add_book): Give the GimpDockSeparators their
	appropriate roles directly at their construction.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawablestack.c
	(gimp_drawable_stack_add_node)
	(gimp_drawable_stack_remove_node): simplify by getting rid of code
	duplication.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawablestack.[ch]: move all the code that creates
	a graph of drawables and all adding/removing/reordering code from
	GimpImage to this file.

	* app/core/gimpimage.c: remove the code here and use the layer
	stack's subgraph instead. Add #if 0'ed code that blends the
	channels on top of that but that doesn't work because channels
	don't provide nodes yet.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-types.h
	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/gimpdrawablestack.[ch]: new GimpList subclass stub
	which will manage the subgraphs of layers and channels and is also
	the first step towards layer tree.

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_init): keep the layers and
	channels in GimpDrawableStacks instead of plain GimpLists.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]: add virtual function
	GimpDrawable::get_node() which returns a node to be plugged into
	the projection.

	* app/core/gimplayer.[ch]: remove public get_node() api and
	implement the virtual function instead.

	* app/core/gimpimage.c: changed accordingly.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c (gimp_move_tool_button_release): flush
	the image after setting active items back from temporarily
	selected ones. Fixes menu item sensitivity.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayer.c: implement GimpItem::visibility-changed
	and turn the layer's node into a nop when the layer is invisible.

	(gimp_layer_get_node): connect the stuff to a nop here too for
	invisible layers.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 554983 – Layers Projection using GEGL

	First projection using GEGL, wheeeee. Disabled by default because
	it doesn't work with floating selection (and will not, FS
	refactoring is in the queue).

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: add gimp_image_get_graph() which
	returns a GeglNode representing the image's projection.

	(gimp_image_add_layer_node)
	(gimp_image_remove_layer_node): new utility functions to add and
	remove layer nodes to/from the graph.

	(gimp_image_add_layer)
	(gimp_image_remove_layer)
	(gimp_image_position_layer): call them to keep the graph up to date.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_real_update): invalidate
	the source node.

	* app/core/gimpprojection.[ch]: keep a projection graph around and
	add gimp_projection_get_sink_node() which returns the node that
	writes to the projection tiles.

	* app/core/gimpprojection-construct.c: add
	gimp_projection_construct_gegl() which is a few-liner that uses a
	GeglProcessor to run the projection graph.

	(gimp_projection_construct): call the new function (disabled by
	default).

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: add new functions
	gimp_image_get_layer_by_index(), _channel_by_index() and
	_vectors_by_index().

	* app/core/gimpprojection-construct.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-layer-select.c
	* app/xcf/xcf-load.c: use them instead of looking the items up
	in image->container and casting the return value.

2008-10-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_translate)
	(gimp_layer_get_node): the "shift" operation's x and y properties
	are doubles not ints.

	(gimp_layer_apply_mask): properly disconnect the mask node.

	(gimp_layer_set_opacity): the opacity node has a "value" property,
	not "opacity".

2008-10-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Address Bug 554983 – Layers Projection using GEGL

	* app/gegl/gimp-gegl-utils.[ch]: add (imcomplete) function
	gimp_layer_mode_to_gegl_operation() from bug #554983.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]: add gimp_drawable_get_source_node()
	which returns a GimpOperationTileSource for the drawable's
	tiles.

	(gimp_drawable_real_set_tiles)
	(gimp_drawable_configure): set the node's "tiles" property.

	* app/core/gimplayer.[ch]: add gimp_layer_get_node() which returns
	a GeglNode with proxy "input" and "output" pads to be plugged
	into the projection graph. The node has children for opacity,
	mask, layer mode and layer offset.

	(gimp_layer_translate)
	(gimp_layer_add_mask)
	(gimp_layer_apply_mask)
	(gimp_layer_set_opacity)
	(gimp_layer_set_mode): reconfigure the respective nodes.

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: keep a "graph" node around and destroy
	it in finalize(). Not even a stub, just a silly GEGL dependency.

2008-10-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Add GEGL_CFLAGS and #includes as if gimpdrawable.h and gimpimage.h
	had a GEGL dependency (they will have in the next commit, but I
	wanted to keep the commit separate).

	to all files which include a drawable subclass or gimpimage.h

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: include <gegl.h> instead of <glib-object.h>
	in all generated files.

	* app/pdb/*-cmds.c: regenerated.

	* data/images/gimp-splash.png: the goat is still sleeping.
	By Aurore Derriennic.

2008-10-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Remove the last code duplication from the undo system (or if not
	the last then at least the most ugly):

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch] (gimp_image_add_layer,channel,vectors):
	add "gboolean push_undo" parameter and add the item without
	touching undo if it's TRUE. Changed assertions from
	g_object_is_floating() to !gimp_item_is_attached() so they also
	take items from the undo stack and not only newly created ones.

	(gimp_image_remove_layer,channel,vectors): add "push_undo"
	parameter here too. Also add a "new_active" parameter where an
	optional new active item can be passed.

	(gimp_image_remove_layer,channel): these functions must not be
	called with push_undo=FALSE and a floating selection attached to
	the layer/channel. This can't currently happen; added warnings in
	case other code is changed and makes it happen anyway.

	* app/core/gimpchannelundo.c
	* app/core/gimplayerundo.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectorsundo.c: use above functions to add/remove
	items instead of duplicating (parts of) their code. Pass
	push_undo=FALSE and the previously active item to the remove()
	functions.

	* app/actions/channels-commands.c
	* app/actions/edit-commands.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.c

	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c
	* app/xcf/xcf-load.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: changed accordingly (pass TRUE
	unless it's a new image like when loading and XCF file).

	* app/pdb/image-cmds.c
	* app/pdb/paths-cmds.c: regenerated.

2008-10-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* data/images/Makefile.am
	* data/images/gimp-devel-logo.png: added 128x128 version of
	wilber-devel.png.

	* app/dialogs/about-dialog.c (about_dialog_load_logo): use
	gimp-devel-logo.png for unstable releasees.

2008-10-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 555697 – build fails if configured with --without-libjpeg

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: applied patch from Simon Zilliken that
	disables the build of the PSD plug-in if JPEG support is disabled.

2008-10-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 134956 – Curves tool doesn't save free curves

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list
	* app/widgets/gimpsettingsbox.[ch]: add signal "file-dialog-setup"
	and emit it when the export/import file chooser is fully
	constructed. Callbacks can then do additional things to the
	dialog, like adding custom buttons.

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.h
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.h: add boolean member
	"export_old_format".

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c (gimp_*_tool_dialog): connect to
	the settings box' "file-dialog-setup".

	(gimp_*_tool_export_setup): new callback which adds a toggle to
	the file choosers that allows to export to the old format.
	Default saving the new format, we defaulted to the old one before.

	(gimp_*_tool_settings_export): check the "export_old_format"
	boolean and only save the cruft format if it is TRUE; chain up
	otherwise, which generically saves the new format.

	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c (gimp_levels_tool_settings_import):
	add the same file format detection code as in the curves tool
	so it transparently loads old and new levels files.

2008-10-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-user-install.c (gimp_user_install_detect_old):
	use GIMP_MINOR_VERSION to determine the version to migrate from.

2008-10-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gimpcurvesconfig.c (gimp_curves_config_save_cruft):
	when saving a curve of type GIMP_CURVE_FREE, don't use
	gimp_curve_get_point() because that returns nothing for free
	curves.

	(gimp_curves_config_load_cruft): reset the curve before loading it.

	* app/core/gimpcurve.c (gimp_curve_get_point): instead of above
	mentioned uninitialized nonsense, at least return -1,-1 for free
	curves.

2008-10-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* tools/Makefile.am: change 2.6 to 2.7 here too.

2008-10-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* README
	* NEWS
	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.7.0 after creating a stable
	gimp-2-6 branch.

2008-10-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.6.1 release.

2008-10-08  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Bug 555587 – PSD file crashes PSD plug-in

	* plug-ins/file-psd/psd-load.c (add_merged_image): Handle
	img_a->alpha_names being NULL.

2008-10-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: cosmetics.

2008-10-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Quick hack I needed for debugging and which doesn't hurt:

	* tools/test-clipboard.c (test_clipboard_paste): allow to paste to
	STDOUT by passing '-' as filename.

2008-10-08  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/file-psd/psd-load.c (add_layers): Decrease scope of
	comp_mode and initialize it.

2008-10-08  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Bug 555222 – PSD Load Plugin: unsupported compression mode

	* plug-ins/file-psd/psd-load.c (add_layers): Some PSD files can
	have channels where a compression method used for the channel data
	is specified, but without any actual channel data. Handle this
	case. Fix inspired by patch from Chris Mohler.

2008-10-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/base/tile-cache.c: use a GMutex instead of a GStaticMutex
	as the latter needs API that causes compiler warnings about
	dereferencing of type-punned pointers.

2008-10-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 555362 – gimp-remote is not working properly

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox-dnd.c (gimp_toolbox_dnd_init): add the
	window itself as drop traget again so gimp-remote works.

2008-10-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/*/Makefile.am: reorder sections consistently. Remove
	redundant CFLAGS.

2008-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 555280 – some gif files will not be open

	* plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c (GetCode): be more tolerant and
	continue loading with a warning message if there are bits missing
	at the end of the file.

2008-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/scale-region.c (scale_region): removed debug
	output.

2008-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/file-gih.c
	* plug-ins/common/file-xbm.c: setting a spin button's
	page_increment to 1 is of no use, set it to 10 instead.

2008-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-menu-path.c (menu_path_mappings): add a
	fallback mapping from <Toolbox> to <Image> so we catch really
	everything that wants to go to <Toolbox>.

2008-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpcontext.c (gimp_context_real_set_display): paranoia
	fix for hypothetical but harmful misbehavior: when setting the
	display from !=NULL to NULL, also set the image to NULL instead of
	relying on whatever obscure implicit behavior of other parts of
	GIMP which set a new display right away or make sure the image
	goes away together with the display.

2008-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_add_mask): g_return_if_fail()
	on the mask's image being the same as the layer's image. The PDB
	already checks for this.

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_add_layer,channel,vectors):
	remove calls to gimp_item_set_image() because we only accept
	itmes of this image anyway.

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/gimpplugin-cleanup.c
	* app/vectors/gimpanchor.c: #include <glib-object.h>, not
	"glib-object.h".

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gegl-types.h: including ourselves serves no purpose.

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Allow to "Open as Layers" in the empty display:

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]: add member
	"gboolean open_as_layers". Rename gimp_file_dialog_set_image() to
	gimp_file_dialog_set_save_image() and add
	gimp_file_dialog_set_open_image() which sets both the image to
	load layers into and the "open_as_layers" boolean.

	* app/dialogs/file-open-dialog.c (file_open_dialog_response): look
	at dialog->open_as_layers instead of dialog->image to decide whether
	to open as layers (that's much more obvious). Enable open as layers
	without existing image by creating the image if it doesn't exist.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c (file_open_dialog_show): add "title"
	parameter and take the uri from the image if none was passed. Use the
	new gimp_file_dialog_set_open_image() instead of poking into the
	dialog struct. Change callers to pass the title and not get the
	uri from the image; instead always pass the image.

	* app/actions/file-actions.c (file_actions_update): keep
	"Open as Layers" sensitive even without image.

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-contiguous-region.c: some formatting cleanups.

	(find_contiguous_segment): changed to return gboolean not gint.

2008-10-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: cache the PangoLayout. Use it not
	only for drawing the numbers, but also to calculate the size
	requisition depending on the actual font size.

2008-10-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: instead of hardcoding a size
	request, implement GtkWidget::size_request and set the size
	depending on the font-scale.

2008-10-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 554890 – JPEG Save Options Dialog does not remember
	Subsampling mode

	* plug-ins/file-jpeg/jpeg.c (run): fixed problem introduced by the
	use of an enum for the subsampling factor.

2008-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c: return errors via return_vals
	instead of displaying them with g_message().

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: increased ruler font scale from
	X_SMALL to SMALL as it appears to be too small for many users.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc: follow that change here, but keep the
	ruler font extra small in the Small theme.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/file-jpeg/jpeg-save.c: some cleanups to the subsampling
	code; in an attempt to fix bug #555031.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: updated GTK+ requirement.

2008-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: depend on GTK+ 2.12.5 so motion history events of
	extended input devices have proper timestamps needed by paint
	tools.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: make the font scale factor
	configurable in gtkrc.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: for documentation, add the default value here.

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c (browser_open_url): removed
	trailing whitespace and corrected error message.

2008-10-03  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c : when ShellExecute() is failing give
	the detailed (currently intentionally untranslated) error message via
	g_message()

	* **/makefie.msc gimpdefs.msc app/gimpcore.def : updated
	* app/core/gimpcurve.c : include <string.h> for memcmp()
	* app/gegl/gimpcurvesconfig.c : include <string.h> for strcmp()

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 554966 – Gimp crashes creating a new image using a template

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c
	(gimp_display_shell_scale_update_scrollbars)
	(gimp_display_shell_scale_update_rulers): bail out early if
	shell->display is NULL.

2008-10-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 554785 – Compile failure on uri-backend-libcurl

	* plug-ins/file-uri/uri-backend-libcurl.c: apply patch from Robby
	Workman which fixes the build for this file.

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed custom error message from checks for babl
	and GEGL. The default error message is a lot more helpful.

2008-10-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpgegltool.c (gimp_gegl_tool_operation_blacklisted):
	add "text" to the list of blacklisted operations.

2008-10-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 554646 – Opening Help crashes GIMP with lqr-plugin installed

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c (gimp_help_get_help_domains): need to
	assign (*foo)[i] and not *foo[i] of a gchar** returned via return
	value location.

2008-10-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/gimppluginprocframe.c: keep a reference to the
	proc_frame's procedure. We can't asume it's always there since it
	could be a temporary one and its plug-in might die during
	procedure execution, taking the temp_proc with it.

2008-10-02  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Bug 553534 – centering issues after image scaling and setting zoom
	to 100%

	* app/display/display-enums.h: Added a GimpZoomFocus enum with
	'best guess', 'pointer' or 'image center' values.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.[ch]
	(gimp_display_shell_scale): Take a GimpZoomFocus parameter and
	pass it on to

	(gimp_display_shell_scale_get_zoom_focus): which returns the
	requested zoom focus point if one was given, else makes a best
	guess.

	* app/actions/view-commands.c
	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c
	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale-dialog.c: For explicit-zoom
	commands like "zoom to 100%", always use the image center as the
	zoom focus point. For all other zooming, continue to use the
	best-guess method.

	* app/display/display-enums.c: Regenerated.

2008-10-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Bug 554898 – Compile failure on uri-backend-wget.c

	* plug-ins/file-uri/uri-backend-wget.c: removed spurious commas
	that broke the build.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added ChangeLog.pre-2-6 and NEWS.pre-2-6.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimptool.c: create the target directory and intermediate
	parent directories as needed. Restores the behavior of the
	gimptool shell script.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am (%.xml): added a dependency on configure.in to
