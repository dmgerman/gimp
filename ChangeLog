	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: fixed non-interactive call.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c (gimp_font_list_add_font): validate the
	font name. This should work around the crashes that Windows users
	were experiencing on startup (bug #132366). The real problem needs
	to be fixed elsewhere though.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_layer): when re-adding
	a layer with mask, don't forget to set layer->mask->removed to FALSE.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: added "gboolean removed" to the GimpItem
	struct. Defaults to FALSE. Set it to TRUE in gimp_item_removed().
	Added public function gimp_item_is_removed().

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_layer)
	(undo_pop_layer_mask) (undo_pop_channel) (undo_pop_vectors):
	set it to FALSE manually when re-adding something from the
	undo stack.

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb.pl: don't allow any operation on items which
	are removed from the image (and exist on the undo stack only).
	Fixes bug #138311.

	* app/pdb/channel_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/color_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/floating_sel_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/paint_tools_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/parasite_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/selection_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/selection_tools_cmds.c

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/slide.scm: applied a (modified) patch
	from Nils Philippsen that fixes bug #138310.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/guillotine.c (guillotine): applied a (modified)
	patch from Joao S. O. Bueno which removes any guides from the
	cropped images. Fixes bug #138314.

	Skip guides which are at the image's edges because the algorithm
	already assumes that there are always guides at these positions.
	Fixes bug #138312.

2004-03-27  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/help/Makefile.am (AM_LDFLAGS): Use -mwindows on Windows
	to avoid a console window popping up.

2004-03-26  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: don't generate code with tabs.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/procedural_db.pdb: convert tabs to spaces in
	helper function declaration.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c: convert tabs to spaces.

	* app/pdb/*.c: regenerated, no code changes, only tabs->spaces.

2004-03-26  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: kill whitespace in blank lines.

	* app/pdb/*.c: regenerated, no code changes, only whitespace.

2004-03-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): return NULL tiles if the
	matrix would transform the drawable into nothing. Fixes the
	core-crashing part of bug #138117 and makes the script fail
	with an execution error.

2004-03-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* README: mention the gimp-perl pre-release and provide a link.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/base/tile-manager.c (tile_manager_new): g_return_if_fail()
	on width, height or bpp <= 0. Doesn't fix anything but badly
	warns (and helps debugging) on bug #138117.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c (gimp_vector_tool_button_release):
	fixed condition which triggers the path tool's undo hack.  Fixes
	bug #138086. Also g_object_unref() the undo step.

	Removed trailing whitespace.

2004-03-25  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-shm.c: close the shm_open fd in the POSIX
	shm case. We were leaking an fd here.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_connect): remove
	unnecessary G_OBJECT() cast in g_object_set() call.

2004-03-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: be verbose about AUTOGEN_CONFIGURE_ARGS in the
	message that is printed if no arguments were passed.
