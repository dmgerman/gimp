	  built...)

	* app/about_dialog.c (about_dialog_create): About dialog now shows
	  "true" version (instead of 1.0) and randomizes the names in the
	  scrollbar instead of showing them in alphabetical order.

Sat Oct 25 14:53:27 1997  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: Eliminated use of

 	  protocol.

	warnings about unused variables.

	* plug-ins/header.c: Raphael Quinet's patch to fix green channel
	and save reasonably-sized lines instead of a single enormous
	string.  Broken compilers barf on them.

	layers dialog if it is invoked when it was already shown.

	* app/commands.c (file_new_cmd_callback): Patch to not let the
	file/new dialog create indexed images.

	* app/tips_dialog.c (read_tips_file): Added fclose(fp).

	* app/gimprc.c (save_gimprc): Added g_free(cur_line).  It was
	missing and thus causing a memory leak.

	(xcf_save_frac_compressed_tile): Fixed pointer printf args.

	* Fixed a *lot* of uninitialized variables in the app/ directory,
 	mainly in the pdb function invoker procedures.  This should
 	supress a trillion compiler warnings.

	* app/brush_select.c: removed brush_select_cancel_callback(); it
	was never being used.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_canvas_events): Changed the type
	of tmask to be GdkModifierType.

	* app/channels_dialog.c: Removed channel_widget_raise_callback()
	and channel_widget_lower_callback(); they were not being used.

	* app/brushes.c: Removed the declaration of int_value (it is never used).

	* app/gimprc.c app/gimprc.h app/commands.c app/tips_dialog.c:
 	save_gimprc() may modify the lists it gets passed (by
 	adding/removing elements).  Changed the prototype to take GList**
 	values instead of just GList*.  Changed the calls to save_gimprc()
	accordingly.

Thu Oct 23 01:46:28 CDT 1997 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

        * app/menus.c: applied patch malheiro-970917 which
          prevents installing bogus accelerator handlers for the

          <taka@ma1.seikyou.ne.jp>

        * plug-ins/gicon.c: fixed the number of return values on save

        * plug-ins/gicon.c: fixed the number of return values on save

          freed params in _gp_params_destroy()

        * libgimp/gimp.c: gimp_run_procedure() now frees proc_run.params,
          since it is allocated in that function and no longer used

        * app/plug_in.c: fixed memory overrun in plug_in.c when 
          nargs < current_return_nvals, in case the plug-in returns bad 
          number of return values.

        * app/plug_in.c: destroy arguments when PDB lookup failed.

        * app/plug_in.c: fixed memory leak in plug_in_params_destroy()
          and plug_in_args_destroy()

	* also added a handful of scripts (predator.scm, circuit.scm, 
	  xach-effect.scm, copy-visible.scm, select_to_brush.scm, 
	  select_to_image.scm, and glow.scm). 
	  see www.gimp.org/~adrian/scripts.html

	* patched maze.c to work better interactively

        * patched noisify.c to show more informative labels and to 
          correct a bug with values of 0 for a channel still allowing
          some noise to be added.

        * changed some of the alien-glow-* scripts to have better defaults

        * moving script-fu wasnt entirely my idea :-)

          scripts from <Image>/Filters/Script-Fu to just
