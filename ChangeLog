	* plug-ins/file-jpeg/jpeg-save.c: some cleanups to the subsampling
	code; in an attempt to fix bug #555031.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: updated GTK+ requirement.

2008-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: depend on GTK+ 2.12.5 so motion history events of
	extended input devices have proper timestamps needed by paint
	tools.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: make the font scale factor
	configurable in gtkrc.

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c (browser_open_url): removed
	trailing whitespace and corrected error message.

2008-10-03  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c : when ShellExecute() is failing give
	the detailed (currently intentionally untranslated) error message via 
	g_message()

	* **/makefie.msc gimpdefs.msc app/gimpcore.def : updated
	* app/core/gimpcurve.c : include <string.h> for memcmp()

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c
	(gimp_display_shell_scale_update_scrollbars)
	(gimp_display_shell_scale_update_rulers): bail out early if
	shell->display is NULL. Fixes crash reported on the mailing-list.

2008-10-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 554785 – Compile failure on uri-backend-libcurl

	Workman which fixes the build for this file.

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed custom error message from checks for babl
	and GEGL. The default error message is a lot more helpful.

2008-10-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpgegltool.c (gimp_gegl_tool_operation_blacklisted):
	add "text" to the list of blacklisted operations.

2008-10-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 554646 – Opening Help crashes GIMP with lqr-plugin installed

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c (gimp_help_get_help_domains): need to
	assign (*foo)[i] and not *foo[i] of a gchar** returned via return
	value location.

2008-10-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/gimppluginprocframe.c: keep a reference to the
	proc_frame's procedure. We can't asume it's always there since it
	could be a temporary one and its plug-in might die during
	procedure execution, taking the temp_proc with it.

2008-10-02  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Bug 553534 – centering issues after image scaling and setting zoom
	to 100%

	* app/display/display-enums.h: Added a GimpZoomFocus enum with
	'best guess', 'pointer' or 'image center' values.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.[ch]
	(gimp_display_shell_scale): Take a GimpZoomFocus parameter and
	pass it on to

	(gimp_display_shell_scale_get_zoom_focus): which returns the
	requested zoom focus point if one was given, else makes a best
	guess.

	* app/actions/view-commands.c
	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c
	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale-dialog.c: For explicit-zoom
	commands like "zoom to 100%", always use the image center as the
	zoom focus point. For all other zooming, continue to use the
	best-guess method.

	* app/display/display-enums.c: Regenerated.

2008-10-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/file-uri/uri-backend-wget.c: removed spurious commas

	parent directories as needed. Restores the behavior of the
	gimptool shell script.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am (%.xml): added a dependency on configure.in to
	make sure that the image-menu.xml file is rebuilt when the version
	number is changed.

2008-10-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* app/plug-in/gimpplugin.c
	* app/widgets/gtkscalebutton.c: : Don't #define _GNU_SOURCE on
	Windows as it confuses newest mingw headers.
