	* README: mention the gimp-perl pre-release and provide a link.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/base/tile-manager.c (tile_manager_new): g_return_if_fail()
	on width, height or bpp <= 0. Doesn't fix anything but badly
	warns (and helps debugging) on bug #138117.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c (gimp_vector_tool_button_release):
	fixed condition which triggers the path tool's undo hack.  Fixes
	bug #138086. Also g_object_unref() the undo step.

	Removed trailing whitespace.

2004-03-25  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-shm.c: close the shm_open fd in the POSIX
	shm case. We were leaking an fd here.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_connect): remove
	unnecessary G_OBJECT() cast in g_object_set() call.

2004-03-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: be verbose about AUTOGEN_CONFIGURE_ARGS in the
	message that is printed if no arguments were passed.
