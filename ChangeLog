	* app/interface.c: Table spacings

Sun Jun 14 23:41:17 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/plug_in.c: Fixed progress code to account for when
	a plugin gets two progress inits

	* app/interface.c: Fixed table allocation sickness.  Now use
	two tables, and a vbox instead of one table so things don't
	get expanded when they shouldn't.  This (table/table_inner)
	should be merged back to 1.0 tree.  The other resize bug is a 
	gtkstatusbar bug.

Sun Jun 14 21:16:42 CDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/gdisplay.h
	* app/interface.c
	* app/plug_in.c
	* app/plug_in.h
	* libgimp/gimp.c: added statusbar and progressbar, which
	the plugins now use if they have a gdisp.  Unfortunately 
	this introduces a resize bug I wasn't able to fix 
	immediately. ;-(

Sun Jun 14 18:37:06 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/blob.[ch] (blob_bounds): Added new files for

	when such a thing exists)

	* app/ink.[ch]: New tool for drawing with a hard-edged
	pressure and tilt-sensitive brush.

	parsing

	* app/Makefile.am app/app_procs.c app/brushes.c app/commands.[ch]
	  app/disp_callbacks.c app/gdisplay.[ch] app/gimprc.c

	  app/paintbrush.c app/palette.c app/scroll.c
	  app/tools.[ch] app/undo.c

	- Added two new dialogs - input devices; (GtkInputDialog)
	  and DeviceStatus - which shows the tool/color for
	  each device.

	- Added device_status_update() call that gets called
	  whenever the tool/color etc. are changed.

	- Added ~/.gimp/devicerc file to store settings

	- Code to draw cursor on canvas for non XFree86 XInput
	  where device can't control cursor and extended input
	  device simultaneously.

	- Changed input handling so that we always use the pointer
	  position from the device, not from gdk_input_window_get_cursor,
	  so that motion and cursor position sync.

	- Various changes so things work with non-integer coordinates

	- Pay attention to pressure and tilt in basic tool support.

        - New paint mode PRESSURE that changes the brush based on
	  the brush pressure

	- Left in a few XInput hacks that should be removed, but I no longer
	  remember what they are.
