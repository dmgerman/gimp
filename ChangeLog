	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_add_mask): g_return_if_fail()
	on the mask's image being the same as the layer's image. The PDB
	already checks for this.

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_add_layer,channel,vectors):
	remove calls to gimp_item_set_image() because we only accept
	itmes of this image anyway.

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/gimpplugin-cleanup.c
	* app/vectors/gimpanchor.c: #include <glib-object.h>, not
	"glib-object.h".

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gegl/gegl-types.h: including ourselves serves no purpose.

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Allow to "Open as Layers" in the empty display:

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]: add member
	"gboolean open_as_layers". Rename gimp_file_dialog_set_image() to
	gimp_file_dialog_set_save_image() and add
	gimp_file_dialog_set_open_image() which sets both the image to
	load layers into and the "open_as_layers" boolean.

	* app/dialogs/file-open-dialog.c (file_open_dialog_response): look
	at dialog->open_as_layers instead of dialog->image to decide whether
	to open as layers (that's much more obvious). Enable open as layers
	without existing image by creating the image if it doesn't exist.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c (file_open_dialog_show): add "title"
	parameter and take the uri from the image if none was passed. Use the
	new gimp_file_dialog_set_open_image() instead of poking into the
	dialog struct. Change callers to pass the title and not get the
	uri from the image; instead always pass the image.

	* app/actions/file-actions.c (file_actions_update): keep
	"Open as Layers" sensitive even without image.

2008-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-contiguous-region.c: some formatting cleanups.

	(find_contiguous_segment): changed to return gboolean not gint.

2008-10-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: cache the PangoLayout. Use it not
	only for drawing the numbers, but also to calculate the size
	requisition depending on the actual font size.

2008-10-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: instead of hardcoding a size
	request, implement GtkWidget::size_request and set the size
	depending on the font-scale.

2008-10-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/file-jpeg/jpeg.c (run): fixed problem introduced by the
	use of an enum for the subsampling factor. Fixes bug #554890.

2008-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c: return errors via return_vals
	instead of displaying them with g_message().

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: increased ruler font scale from
	X_SMALL to SMALL as it appears to be too small for many users.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc: follow that change here, but keep the
	ruler font extra small in the Small theme.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/file-jpeg/jpeg-save.c: some cleanups to the subsampling
	code; in an attempt to fix bug #555031.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: updated GTK+ requirement.

2008-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: depend on GTK+ 2.12.5 so motion history events of
	extended input devices have proper timestamps needed by paint
	tools.

2008-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpruler.c: make the font scale factor
	configurable in gtkrc.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: for documentation, add the default value here.

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c (browser_open_url): removed
	trailing whitespace and corrected error message.

2008-10-03  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* plug-ins/common/web-browser.c : when ShellExecute() is failing give
	the detailed (currently intentionally untranslated) error message via 
	g_message()

	* **/makefie.msc gimpdefs.msc app/gimpcore.def : updated
	* app/core/gimpcurve.c : include <string.h> for memcmp()
	* app/gegl/gimpcurvesconfig.c : include <string.h> for strcmp()

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c
	(gimp_display_shell_scale_update_scrollbars)
	(gimp_display_shell_scale_update_rulers): bail out early if
	shell->display is NULL. Fixes crash reported on the mailing-list.

2008-10-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 554785 – Compile failure on uri-backend-libcurl

	* plug-ins/file-uri/uri-backend-libcurl.c: apply patch from Robby
	Workman which fixes the build for this file.

2008-10-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed custom error message from checks for babl
	and GEGL. The default error message is a lot more helpful.

2008-10-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpgegltool.c (gimp_gegl_tool_operation_blacklisted):
	add "text" to the list of blacklisted operations.

2008-10-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Bug 554646 – Opening Help crashes GIMP with lqr-plugin installed

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c (gimp_help_get_help_domains): need to
	assign (*foo)[i] and not *foo[i] of a gchar** returned via return
	value location.

2008-10-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/gimppluginprocframe.c: keep a reference to the
	proc_frame's procedure. We can't asume it's always there since it
	could be a temporary one and its plug-in might die during
	procedure execution, taking the temp_proc with it.

2008-10-02  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Bug 553534 – centering issues after image scaling and setting zoom
	to 100%

	* app/display/display-enums.h: Added a GimpZoomFocus enum with
	'best guess', 'pointer' or 'image center' values.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.[ch]
	(gimp_display_shell_scale): Take a GimpZoomFocus parameter and
	pass it on to

	(gimp_display_shell_scale_get_zoom_focus): which returns the
	requested zoom focus point if one was given, else makes a best
	guess.

	* app/actions/view-commands.c
	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c
	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale-dialog.c: For explicit-zoom
	commands like "zoom to 100%", always use the image center as the
	zoom focus point. For all other zooming, continue to use the
	best-guess method.

	* app/display/display-enums.c: Regenerated.

2008-10-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/file-uri/uri-backend-wget.c: removed spurious commas
	that broke the build.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added ChangeLog.pre-2-6 and NEWS.pre-2-6.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimptool.c: create the target directory and intermediate
	parent directories as needed. Restores the behavior of the
	gimptool shell script.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am (%.xml): added a dependency on configure.in to
	make sure that the image-menu.xml file is rebuilt when the version
	number is changed.

2008-10-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* app/plug-in/gimpplugin.c
	* app/widgets/gtkscalebutton.c: : Don't #define _GNU_SOURCE on
	Windows as it confuses newest mingw headers.

2008-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.6.1 (interface age 1).

2008-09-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.6.0 release.
