	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c: fixed param passing for
	INT8 and INT16 types. This used to fail on big endian machines

	* plug-ins/maze/maze.c: properly handle INT8 and INT16 types.
	With these two fixes, circuit.scm will no longer crash on
	big endian machines

Sun Jun  7 00:19:22 EDT 1998  Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/commands.c: Reworked the file_new dialog to
	be a little more useful. Added entries for a height
	and width in the unit of your choice, and a resolution.
	Not everythings hooked up yet, but its getting there.

Fri Jun  5 22:37:40 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* app/Makefile.am app/app_procs.c app/brushes.c app/commands.[ch]
	  app/disp_callbacks.c app/gdisplay.[ch] app/gimprc.c
	  app/interface.[ch] app/menus.c app/paint_core.[ch]
	  app/paintbrush.c app/palette.c app/scroll.c
	  app/tools.[ch] app/undo.c

	- Added two new dialogs - input devices; (GtkInputDialog)
	  and DeviceStatus - which shows the tool/color for
	  each device.

	- Added device_status_update() call that gets called
	  whenever the tool/color etc. are changed.

	- Added ~/.gimp/devicerc file to store settings

	- Code to draw cursor on canvas for non XFree86 XInput
	  where device can't control cursor and extended input
	  device simultaneously.

	- Changed input handling so that we always use the pointer
	  position from the device, not from gdk_input_window_get_cursor,
	  so that motion and cursor position sync.

	- Various changes so things work with non-integer coordinates

	- Pay attention to pressure and tilt in basic tool support.

        - New paint mode PRESSURE that changes the brush based on
	  the brush pressure

	- Left in a few XInput hacks that should be removed, but I no longer
	  remember what they are.
