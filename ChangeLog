2004-12-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfgbgeditor.[ch]: use the coordinates passed in
	the color drop callback instead of remembering them in the
	drag_motion handler.

2004-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/kernelgen.c: fixed rounding so that all brush kernels are
	created with a constant sum of 256.

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore-kernels.h: regenerated.

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask): use
	the constant defined un app/paint/gimpbrushcore-kernels.h. Should
	give a tiny speedup.

2004-12-31  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c: invert dependence of brush size on
	pressure, using formula from Dave Ahlswede in bug #149576.
	
2004-12-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Applied modified patch from Ben Campbell which adds drop
	coordinates to the color drop callback and uses it to insert
	colors in the palette editor. Extended the patch to add drop
	coordinates to all drop callbacks.

	* app/core/gimppalette.[ch]: added gimp_palette_insert_entry().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.[ch]: added drop coordinates
	to all drop callbacks.

	* app/dialogs/palette-import-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox-indicator-area.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorselect.c: changed accordingly. The passed
	drop coordiantes are so far unused.

	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c: use the drop coordinates to
	insert the new color into the palette at the right place instead
	of always appending. Fixes bug #150030.

2004-12-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c
	* app/actions/tools-commands.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimptoolview.[ch]: applied a (modified) patch from
	Joao S. O. Bueno which adds "raise" and "lower" actions and
	their buttons in the tool dialog. Fixes bug #158666.
	Cleaned up the tool action callbacks.

2004-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_preview.c (render_rgb_image): use the proper
	image type and rowstride. Fixes bug #162592.

	gimp_coordinates_new().  Fixes problem described in
	comment 6 of bug #162387.
	
2004-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped gimp_app_version and gimp_user_version to 2.3.

	* app/pdb/brush_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* app/pdb/palette_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpbrush_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimpbrush_pdb.h

2004-12-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/file-save-dialog.c (file_save_dialog_response):
	handle a NULL return value from gtk_file_chooser_get_uri(). Fixes
	bug #162443.

2004-12-29  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_preferences.[ch]: replace home-brewn color
	selection by GimpColorButton.

2004-12-29  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-rectangle.[ch]
	* plug-ins/gfig/images/stock-rectangle.png: news files to implement a
	rectangle tool to gfig.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-stock.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-stock.h

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: modified to support the new shape and
	implement two new filling types: vertical and horizontal gradients.
	These gradients are imho much more useful than the shapeburst one.

2004-12-28  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/compose.c: Recompose did not properly 
	handle case where layer with alpha is decomposed into
	something that does not encode alpha -- now does.

	
2004-12-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-edit.c (gimp_edit_set_buffer): new utility
	function instead of code duplication.

2004-12-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/base/base-enums.[ch]: added translatable strings to the
	GimpLayerModeEffects enum because they will soon disappear from
	widgets/gimpwidgets-constructors.c

2004-12-28  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/compose.c: add "Recompose" (plug_in_recompose) 
	as described on dev mailing list.

	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c: add "decompose-data" parasite
	when decoposing, to support Recompose.  Also add missing

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.1 release.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.[ch] (gimp_install_procedure, gimp_install_temp_proc):
	renamed menu_path parameter to menu_label and added a pointer to
	gimp_plugin_menu_register()

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c (gimp_size_box_constructor): removed
	unused variables.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask):
	reverted Bill's change since it is obviously not the right fix.
	Allocate the array larger to avoid the crash. We need to
	investigate bug #161323 further.

2004-12-27  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask):
	don't set array outside its bounds.  Should fix bug #161323.
	Credit to Robert Ãgren for figuring out what was wrong.
	
2004-12-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c: if possible, use
	gimp_preview_draw_buffer() so that the selection mask is correctly
	previewed. Minor cleanups.

2004-12-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpregioniterator.c: added some checks to avoid
	division by zero.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.[ch]: minor cleanups, improved
	API documentation.

	cleanups.

2004-12-26  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/core/gimpbrush.c: don't ask for preview with
	zero width or height, fixes bug #162232.

	* app/base/brush-scale.c: remove tabs and trailing
	whitespace.

2004-12-26  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	as suggested by mitch.

2004-12-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/weave.scm: limit the "Thread
	intensity" parameter to [0..100] because it's used as layer
	opacity. Fixes bug #162182.

2004-12-24  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	in file name before showing error message, 
	fixes bug #162147.

	* app/core/gimp-gui.c
	* app/widgets/gimpmessagebox.c: be a bit more paranoid
	about validating utf8 for messages.

2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* gimp/app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: fix incorrect Update
	Policy for size entry as pointed out by mitch.

	* plug-ins/common/spread.c
	* plug-ins/common/tileit.c
	* plug-ins/common/whirlpinch.c: make sure tile cache is allocated
	before preview is shown -- significant speedup in some cases,
	minimal in others.

	* plug-ins/common/sel_gauss.c: give it a tile cache (didn't
	have one).  Still very slow but a little better.
	
2004-12-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c (despeckle_median): don't call
	gimp_progress_update() for each and every pixel. Every few rows
	should be enough. Fixes bug #162129.

	* plug-ins/common/blur.c: set progress to 1.0 when done, not to 100.

2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/mblur.c: set up tile cache before
	creating dialog -- major speedup in preview.
	
2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* gimp/app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: use gimp_coordinates_new()
	instead of duplicating a lot of code.  Fixes bug #161756.
	
	* gimp/app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c: small change in 
	chainbutton handling to make above work.

2004-12-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc-frame.[ch]: made plug_in_proc_frame_free()
	a static function.

2004-12-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Item conversion depends on the old *and* the new item type, so
	it can't live in the old item's vtable only:

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: split GimpItem::convert() into
	GimpItem::convert_from() (which is called on the old item and
	creates the new item) and GimpItem::convert_to() (which is called
	on the new item). This way functions from the old *and* new items'
	vtables are called and it's possible to convert between item types
	which live on different branches of the class hierarchy or to item
	types which live further down the class tree than the old item.

	(gimp_item_convert): call ::convert_to() on the new item created
	by ::convert_from().

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c: changed ::convert() implementation
	to ::convert_from().

	* app/core/gimplayer.c: changed ::convert() to ::convert_to().
	Fixes bug #161877.

2004-12-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/asc2img.scm: removed this script as it
	is broken beyond repair and the functionality is provided by the
	text tool itself.

2004-12-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS: added NEWS for the stable branch (no, we haven't branched
	yet).

	* Makefile.am
	* NEWS.pre-2.2: moved old NEWS here.
	
2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (blur_line): fixed the degenerate case
	where the source image is smaller than the blurred area. This used
	to give artefacts at the borders.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: more code cleanup and micro
	optimizations.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <neumann@jpk.com>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: reverted the last change since it
	introduced artefacts. Even had to increase the border around the
	previewed area. Fixed a bug in unsharp_region() where it was using
	the wrong source region for blurring.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: compute preview for the displayed area
	only, some more code cleanup.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (preview_update): fixed bug #157910.
	More code cleanup and some trivial optimizations.

2004-12-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	(gradient_editor_actions_update): if the dialog is insensitive,
	disable all actions which modify the gradient. Fixes bug #161411.

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-commands.c: update the UI manager
	after setting the dialog sensitive/insensitive so te above works.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: more code cleanup.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_draw_region):
	unset the dirty flag on the GimpPixelRgn used to iterate the region.

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c (gimp_pixel_rgn_init): improved docs.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: code cleanup, no real changes.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.2.1.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c: applied patch from
	Yeti that fixes a memory corruption (bug #161729).

2004-12-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.0 release.
