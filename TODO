Please add things to this file when the need to do them is
discovered.  

gui/functionality seperation
	both file scope wise and in use, particulay so that
	the gui version of the tool uses the pdb whenever possible
	)for finding bugs, and for macro recording)


fix the palette dialogs (it would be nice to be able to actually edit
 palettes and the like), also replace that menubox with a list or
 something

tools...er, fix em or soemthing

integrate palette saving into core

more configurebilty (eek)

fix stuff so that the tile size could actually be changed eventually?

file new dialog stuff   (i'm working on this....)
	1. default to size of cut buffer
	2. add units and resolution options
	3. make x,y values have dropdowns for last 5 or so used sizes
	4. maybe an estimate of how much ram the image will take?
	5. maybe some "preset" common image sizes?

export filters...

previews in file save (for jpeg compression, etc)

save/restore state of major dialogs (exported to the PDB too)

keybindings for simple "binary" tools (for ex, flip should
flip horiz normal, and shift+click to shift vertically)

curve deal in the gradient editor?

some degree of drawing tools, straight line, etc... 

paths, and better beziers would be a nice toch

Macro recording and better scripting support

More Xinput stuff ( gradient brushes, pen "strokes" ?)

natural media tools (raph?)

A "Revert To" menu options

Redesign of the Blend Tool dialog? (its rather large...)

"Fit text to selection"? make selection, scare text to fit it...

a complete groundup rewrite of iscissors?

Interactive resixing of layers (maybe with handles on the edges)

progress bars on long proccesses?

status bars on image window (maybe swallow pluign progress bars, show
current x,Y, file type, etc...)

"open into layer" and new image from cut buffer stuff should
perhaps be in core?

drag & drop for layers (both in the dialog, and from image to image)

more indicators of current status (X,Y position, selection size and
placemtn etc ), maybe in another dialog, maybe a status bar?

Clean up swapfiles?

Automagically guess whats a good tilecache size?

an artist palette type of color selector? (maybe based on raphs
watercolor deal?) notebooked with the regular color selector?

BETTER FONT SUPPORT! even if we have to go around X.
and a better font selector too

ability to get an exact count of the total number of colors
in the image

indexed/color reducing to arbitrary number of colors?

Folding box for the toolbar. So you can have it be 9x3 like now, or
1x27, or whatever... gyve has rought outlines of a widget to do this...

optimise transform_core (special cases, fft stuff?, optimizations only
	raph understands, etc...)

brush-shaped cursors...

pixmap brushes...
