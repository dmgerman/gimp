	  This is directly connected to the objectification task mentioned

      <description>
	<p>
	  Headers should only include other headers if absolutely necessary
	  (for derived objects for example). All functions must be
	  properly prototyped.

      <description>
	<p>
	  The GimpBrush object we have now is not a generic BrushProvider.
	  We need an abstract object to derive the different kinds of brushes
	  from (BrushPipes, parametric brushes, ...). It has to provide 
	  methods for the PaintCore to transparently select and use the brush 
	  data. Paint tools should have to care about the brush type as less 
	  as possible.
