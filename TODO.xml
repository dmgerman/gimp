      <description>
	<p>
	  Directly derived from GObject, should probably have a name 
	  argument.

      <description>
	<p>
	  GimpDrawable, Layer, GimpImage, GDisplay need to be redone as
	  proper GimpObjects. Write new objects (with proper names) and 
	  port all stuff to the new objects incrementally.

      <title>Generic object container(s)</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  A GimpContainer that holds GimpObject objects. Comparable to 
	  the GCimContainer, but no serialization for now. Should probably
	  dispatch "changed" (or other) signals from its children.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This container will be used for lists of brushes, patterns, 
	  layers, channels, paths, ...

      <title>Abstract GimpBrush object and derived brush types</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  The GimpBrush object we have now is not a generic BrushProvider.
	  We need an abstract object to derive the different kinds of brushes
	  from (BrushPipes, parametric brushes, ...). It has to provide 
	  methods for the PaintCore to transparently select and use the brush 
	  data.

	  Views on data stored in a GimpContainer. The objects need to provide
	  hooks that this view can use to show data like patterns, brushes, 
	  etc. in different views (list, grid, ...)

      <description>
	<p>
	  A generic preview widget with functions like scrolling and zooming
	  useable by effect filters. Should have adaptive supersampling, 
	  progressive display (if possible) and other neat stuff.

      <title>Context-sensitive translations</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  The same english string used in different contexts may need to
	  be translated differently in other languages. Think of a way to
	  implement this using gettext or come up with something better.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There is a patch with a possible solution on ftp.gimp.org,
	  but actually we'd like something cleaner if possible.
