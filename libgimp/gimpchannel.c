comment|/**  * gimp_channel_new:  * @image_ID: The image to which to add the channel.  * @name: The channel name.  * @width: The channel width.  * @height: The channel height.  * @opacity: The channel opacity.  * @color: The channel compositing color.  *  * Create a new channel.  *  * This procedure creates a new channel with the specified width and  * height. Name, opacity, and color are also supplied parameters. The  * new channel still needs to be added to the image, as this is not  * automatic. Add the new channel with the gimp_image_insert_channel()  * command. Other attributes such as channel show masked, should be  * set with explicit procedure calls. The channel's contents are  * undefined initially.  *  * Returns: The newly created channel.  */
