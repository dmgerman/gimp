These are the things that need to be done for the next distributions:

- Include these plug-ins - why they were not included:

  GAG (Daniel Skarda) - This plug-in builds expressions.c from a perl
  source file and a data file.  I am not sure how to tell that to
  Automake.  Can anyone please look into this?

  Lighting Effects (Tom Bech) - It has not yet been ported to the new
  plug-in API, but Tom is working on that.

  riffl (Kim-Minh Kaplan) - This plug-in has a semi-complex directory
  structure, including an IFF library.  This should be well-integrated
  into the Gimp's automake/autoconf structure.

  xmorph (Michael Gourlay) - It uses Xaw instead of GTK.  This is no
  problem (I think), but I would like to do some additional testing
  before I include it.
