expertise: plugin<->gimp communication/PDB 
	   invocation of the gimp menus. Some gimp plugins and 
	   libgimp. Also some bits of script-fu.
current work:  Allow the gradient/brush/pattern menus to be 
	   controlled via the PDB including callbacks. Got an
           idea about some type of gimp organizer but thats
           the secret project.
