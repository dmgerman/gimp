If you want to hack on the GIMP project, it will make you life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU autoconf 2.13
	- GNU automake 1.4
	- GNU libtool 1.2d
	- GNU gettext 10.35
		Available in ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu


These should be available by ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Beta software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing gimp via CVS, then you will need to take several
steps to get it to compile.  You can do all these steps at once
by running:

        cvsroot/gimp# ./autogen.sh

Basically this does the following for you:

        cvsroot/gimp# aclocal; automake; autoconf

        The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
        can run the configure script in cvsroot/gimp to create all
        the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool
in your path. Also make sure gtk.m4 is in the same --prefix relative
to your automake installation.

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.

If at all possible, please use CVS to get the latest development version of
gimp, as well as the CVS version of gtk+.  You can do the following to get
gimp and gtk+ from cvs:

   $ export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gimp.org:/cvs/gnome'
   $ cvs login
     (there is no password, just hit return)
   $ cvs -z3 checkout gtk+ gimp

Please submit patches to the gimp-developer@scam.xcf.berkeley.edu mailing
list.  All kinds of contributions are accepted.  Patches that you wish to go
into the distribution should also be uploaded to ftp://ftp.gimp.org/incoming.
Follow the rules there for naming your patches.

Please notice that some files in the source are generated from other sources. 
Among these are the files ending in _pdb.[ch] in the libgimp directory
and the files ending in _cmds.c in the app subdirectory. Those are generated
from the respective .pdb files in tools/pdbgen/pdb. All those files have a
short notice about being autogenerated somewhere at the top.
