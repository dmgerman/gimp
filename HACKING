If you want to hack on the GIMP project, it will make you life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU autoconf 2.12
	- GNU automake 1.2d
		Available in ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey
	- GNU libtool 1.0f

These should be available by ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Beta software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing gnome via CVS, then you will need to take several
steps to get it to compile.  These are:

    cvsroot/gimp# aclocal; automake; autoconf

N.b., the "configure" script will not exist until you take these
steps.  

Before running configure, make sure you have libtool in your path.
