The GNU Image Manipulation Program Version 2.1
----------------------------------------------

This is the development branch of The GIMP. Here's where new features
are being added. In a not too distant future the next stable GIMP
release, GIMP 2.2, will emerge out of this.



Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.2
=================================

- Further improvements to the new input controllers; added a keyboard
  controller.

- Show image preview in GFig plug-in, started a complete overhaul.

- Added Difference of Gaussians edge detection plug-in.

- Added more possibilities for drag'n'drop:
   * layers dialog accepts URI, color and pattern drops
   * path dialog takes and offers DND of SVG data

- Implemented PDB function gimp-path-get-point-at-dist.

- Allow to use the color picker to edit palettes (as in gimp-1.2).

- Improvements and code cleanup in gimpressionist plug-in.

- Allow to cut'n'paste image data between GIMP and other applications
  (for example Abiword) using the system clipboard.

- List unsaved images in Quit dialog.

- Completed core/gui separation. Optionally build a gimp-console
  application that behaves like 'gimp --no-interface' and doesn't link
  to GTK+ at all.

- Deprecated GimpPixmap and ported almost all users to GtkImage.

- Moved display projection code into a GimpProjection object. This means
  there's finally only a single projection per image.

- Introduced GimpPickable interface and implemented it for all core
  objects that you can pick colors from.

- Write smaller indexed MNG files.

- Fixed issues with the internal statusbar API.

- Allow for multiple light sources in the Lighting plug-in.

- Redone file type selection in file load/save dialogs.

- Removed HRZ plug-in.

- Improved developers documentation.

- Improved quality of antialiasing in the ellipse select tool.

- Lots of bug fixes and other goodies. Check the ChangeLog for details.

Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.1
=================================

- Added support for loading patterns in formats supported by GdkPixbuf
  (most notably PNG and JPEG).

- Use ARGB cursors when supported by the windowing system. Added nice
  new tool cursors.

- Added previews to Solid Noise and Unsharp Mask plug-ins.

- Improvements for painting with pressure-sensitive devices.

- Added preview for transform tools.

- Merged the Gaussian Blur plug-ins.

- Simplified the Blur plug-in.

- Reorganized the Preferences dialog.

- Dispatch Enter, Return, Backspace and Delete key events to the tools
  and use them where it makes sense.

- Some optimizations to the tile system, the gradient rendering and to 
  the cubic interpolation routine.

- Show the brush outline while painting.

- Added an interface that allows to add controller modules. Such a module
  can dispatch events to The GIMP which are mapped to actions by a
  user-configurable mapping table.  Added controller modules for mouse
  wheel, midi and linux_input devices.

- Applied HIG capitalization style to all(?) dialogs.

- Lots of bug fixes and other goodies. Check the ChangeLog for details.

Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.0
=================================

GIMP 2.1.0 includes the following enhancements over GIMP 2.0:

 - Major user interface improvements.

   * Large parts of the GIMP user interface have been changed to 
     comply better with the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines. This is
     an ongoing effort and the interface may still be inconsistent in
     a few places.

   * Users are now allowed to clear the undo history.

   * The unit to be used for the rulers and the coordinates display is now
     a display property and can be changed in the statusbar of the image
     window.

   * New widgets and frameworks provided by GTK+ 2.4 are used; this means

     + uses the new GtkFileChooser dialog, vastly improving the file
       dialogs.
     + includes port of menus to GtkUIManager, which creates all core
       menus from XML files at runtime. This means that menu items can
       be rearranged by users simply by editing these files.
     + uses a global accelerator table in all docks and image windows.
       This means that a hotkey will do the same thing regardless of
       which dock or image window you are using.
     + adds replacement widgets based on GtkComboBox for most uses of
       GtkOptionMenu (GimpUnitMenu remains to be ported)
     + adds GimpContainerEntry, a GtkEntry with completion based on
       the contents of a GimpContainer.
     + makes the order and visibility of tools in the toolbox configurable
     + allows keeping toolbox and dock windows above other windows (if
       the WM supports this hint)

   * The toolbox now has an optional preview of the active image.

   * The image window now accepts file/uri drops.

 - More internal cleanup and refactoring of the core object model.

 - The brush rendering code has been separated from the generic paint
   tool code. The ink tool is now a paint tool (it can do straight
   lines) and the new infrastructure allows to implement new kinds of
   paint methods like vector based painting.

 - Gradients can now be created, deleted, renamed and edited through
   the PDB.

 - Some changes to plug-ins.

   * Plug-ins can now register the same procedures in multiple places (the
     API to register menu entries has been changed in a backward-compatible 
     fashion).

   * Plug-ins can now optionally register a menu icon.

   * File plug-ins can now register a mime-type.

   * All plug-in dialogs have been reviewed and changed to make them
     comply better with the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.

   * All plug-ins that need to access files use the new GtkFileChooser
     dialog.

   * The obsolete AlienMap and GIcon plug-ins were removed.  AlienMap2
     does everything than AlienMap did, and the GIMP-specific GIcon format
     has not been used by anything for quite some time now.

   * A plug-in to load and save windows icon files has been added.
