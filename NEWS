   the layer
 - Allow to specify written language in the Text Tool
 - Support custom mapping curves for input device properties like "Pressure"
 - New desktop launcher icon

   Window' to avoid conflict with Ctrl+Shift+R for 'Show Rulers'
 - Add 'Windowsâ†’Hide docks' menu item that does what 'Tab' does and also displays
   it's state. Make the state persistent across sessions, too.
 - Make dock window title separators translatable

   from a stack of layers, to GEGL

 - Prepare better and more intuitive handling of the floating
   selection

   image

   File->Debug->Benchmark Projection
 - When using GEGL for the projection, use CIELCH instead of HSV/HSL
