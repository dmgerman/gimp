The GNU Image Manipulation Program Version 2.1
----------------------------------------------

This is the development branch of The GIMP. Here's where new features
are being added. Sometime this summer the next stable GIMP release,
GIMP 2.2, will emerge out of this.


Overview of Changes since 2.0
=============================
GIMP 2.2 includes the following enhancements:
 - Major user interface improvements
   * Work has begun to make the GIMP user interface comply better with
     the GNOME HIG. This is an ongoing effort and the interface is quite
     inconsistent at the moment.
   * Users are now allowed to clear the undo history.
   * Pixels are now considered image units; this simplifies the handling of 
     units.
   * New widgets and frameworks provided by GTK+ 2.4 are used; this means
     + uses the new GtkFileChooser dialog, vastly improving the file dialogs.
     + includes port of menus to GtkUIManager, which creates all core menus from
       XML files at runtime. This means that menu items can be rearrainged by 
       users simply by editing the files.
     + uses a global accelerator table in all docks and image windows.  This 
       means that a hotkey will do the same thing regardless of which dock
       or image window you are using.
     + adds replacement widgets based on GtkComboBox for most uses of
       GtkOptionMenu (GimpUnitMenu remains to be ported)
     + makes the order and visibility of tools in the toolbox configurable
       (This effort has not yet been completed.)
     + allows keeping toolbox and dock windows above other windows (if the WM 
       supports this hint)
 - Some changes to plug-ins
   * Plug-ins can now register the same procedures in multiple places (the
     API to register menu entries has been changed in a backward-compatible 
     fashion.)
   * The obsolete AlienMap and GIcon plug-ins were removed.  AlienMap 2 does
     everything than AlienMap did, and the GIMP-specific GIcon format has not
     been used by anything for quites some time now.
   * A plug-in to load and save windows icon files has been added.
