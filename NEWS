The GNU Image Manipulation Program Version 2.1
----------------------------------------------

This is the development branch of The GIMP. Here's where new features
are being added. Very soon now, the next stable GIMP release, GIMP 2.2,
will emerge out of this.



Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.4
=================================

- Rewritten internal handling of progress indicators. Embed progress
  bars to the File Open dialog to reduce annoying dialogs popping up.

- Added an API for plug-ins to embed a progress bar. Let the Script-Fu
  dialog swallow the progress bars created by running the script.

- Ported remaining plug-ins and modules to GimpPreviewArea and removed
  GimpOldPreview.

- Show progress while converting from RGB to Indexed Colors.

- Added new plug-ins Cartoon, Neon, Photocopy and Softglow.

- Let color selectors adapt to the given size.

- Import basic SVG shapes as paths.

- Improved GIH and guillotine plug-ins.

- Added GimpMessageBox widget. Collect error messages in a single
  dialog to reduce popups.

- Renamed the core GimpPreview widget to GimpView.

- Added a GimpPreview widget to libgimpwidgets. This is an abstract
  class that combines a GimpPreviewArea with scrollbars and a "Preview"
  toggle button.

- Added GimpDrawablePreview derived from GimpPreview.

- Improved previews in Unsharp Mask, Scatter RGB, Sharpen, Spread and
  Grid plug-ins.

- Added previews to Edge, Gaussian Blur, Neon, Soft Glow, Sobel and
  Selective Gaussian Blur.

- Added a logarithmic mode for the slider in a GimpScaleEntry.

- Script-Fu code cleanups.

- Fixed composite assembly code.

- Pass user settings for the checkerboard to plug-ins.

- Image comment, if any, is now shown within the info window.

Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.3
=================================

- Cleanups to the MMX code and the composite subsystem in general

- Cleanups and fixes to Gimpressionst plug-in (bug #148088)

- Redone light settings GUI for Lighting plug-in.

- Added keyboard shortcut editor to preferences dialog (bug #142922)

  buttons in the preferences dialog.

- Added support for loading gradients from SVG files. This allows to
  share gradient definitions with Inkscape and Sodipodi (bug #148127)

- Added parsers for the various ways to define a color in SVG to
  libgimpcolor.

- Added GimpColorHexEntry widget to libgimpwidgets. It displays colors
  in hexadecimal represention and takes hex and SVG color names as input.

- Added GimpCellRendererColor and GimpCellRendererToggle to libgimpwidgets.

- Renamed GimpColor boxed type to GimpRGB and moved it to libgimpcolor.

- Moved GIMP_TYPE_UNIT and GIMP_TYPE_MEMSIZE to libgimpbase.

- Fixes to the BMP loader plug-in (bug #143682).

- Fixes to the Decompose plug-in (bug #147603).

- Ported TWAIN plug-in to Mac OS X (bug #147962).

- Support motion event history as provided by some input device drivers.

- Let the undo system know more specifically what an undo step
  does. Use that info to keep tools active across modifications to
  the image that don't affect the tool (bug #109561).

- Changed default config for keyboard controller to allow scrolling
  the display using the cursor keys (#53988).

- Added GimpPreviewArea widget as replacement for the deprecated
  GtkPreview widget. Ported most plug-ins to the new widget.

Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.2
=================================

- Further improvements to the new input controllers; added a keyboard
  controller.

- Show image preview in GFig plug-in, started a complete overhaul.

- Added Difference of Gaussians edge detection plug-in.

- Added more possibilities for drag'n'drop:
   * layers dialog accepts URI, color and pattern drops
   * path dialog takes and offers DND of SVG data

- Implemented PDB function gimp-path-get-point-at-dist.

- Allow to use the color picker to edit palettes (as in gimp-1.2).

- Improvements and code cleanup in gimpressionist plug-in.

- Allow to cut'n'paste image data between GIMP and other applications
  (for example Abiword) using the system clipboard.

- List unsaved images in Quit dialog.

- Completed core/gui separation. Optionally build a gimp-console
  application that behaves like 'gimp --no-interface' and doesn't link
  to GTK+ at all.

- Deprecated GimpPixmap and ported almost all users to GtkImage.

- Moved display projection code into a GimpProjection object. This means
  there's finally only a single projection per image.

- Introduced GimpPickable interface and implemented it for all core
  objects that you can pick colors from.

- Write smaller indexed MNG files.

- Fixed issues with the internal statusbar API.

- Allow for multiple light sources in the Lighting plug-in.

- Redone file type selection in file load/save dialogs.

- Removed HRZ plug-in.

- Improved developers documentation.

- Improved quality of antialiasing in the ellipse select tool.

- Lots of bug fixes and other goodies. Check the ChangeLog for details.

Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.1
=================================

- Added support for loading patterns in formats supported by GdkPixbuf
  (most notably PNG and JPEG).

- Use ARGB cursors when supported by the windowing system. Added nice
  new tool cursors.

- Added previews to Solid Noise and Unsharp Mask plug-ins.

- Improvements for painting with pressure-sensitive devices.

- Added preview for transform tools.

- Merged the Gaussian Blur plug-ins.

- Simplified the Blur plug-in.

- Reorganized the Preferences dialog.

- Dispatch Enter, Return, Backspace and Delete key events to the tools
  and use them where it makes sense.

- Some optimizations to the tile system, the gradient rendering and to 
  the cubic interpolation routine.

- Show the brush outline while painting.

- Added an interface that allows to add controller modules. Such a module
  can dispatch events to The GIMP which are mapped to actions by a
  user-configurable mapping table.  Added controller modules for mouse
  wheel, midi and linux_input devices.

- Applied HIG capitalization style to all(?) dialogs.

- Lots of bug fixes and other goodies. Check the ChangeLog for details.

Overview of Changes in GIMP 2.1.0
=================================

GIMP 2.1.0 includes the following enhancements over GIMP 2.0:

 - Major user interface improvements.

   * Large parts of the GIMP user interface have been changed to 
     comply better with the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines. This is
     an ongoing effort and the interface may still be inconsistent in
     a few places.

   * Users are now allowed to clear the undo history.

   * The unit to be used for the rulers and the coordinates display is now
     a display property and can be changed in the statusbar of the image
     window.

   * New widgets and frameworks provided by GTK+ 2.4 are used; this means

     + uses the new GtkFileChooser dialog, vastly improving the file
       dialogs.
     + includes port of menus to GtkUIManager, which creates all core
       menus from XML files at runtime. This means that menu items can
       be rearranged by users simply by editing these files.
     + uses a global accelerator table in all docks and image windows.
       This means that a hotkey will do the same thing regardless of
       which dock or image window you are using.
     + adds replacement widgets based on GtkComboBox for most uses of
       GtkOptionMenu (GimpUnitMenu remains to be ported)
     + adds GimpContainerEntry, a GtkEntry with completion based on
       the contents of a GimpContainer.
     + makes the order and visibility of tools in the toolbox configurable
     + allows keeping toolbox and dock windows above other windows (if
       the WM supports this hint)

   * The toolbox now has an optional preview of the active image.

   * The image window now accepts file/uri drops.

 - More internal cleanup and refactoring of the core object model.

 - The brush rendering code has been separated from the generic paint
   tool code. The ink tool is now a paint tool (it can do straight
   lines) and the new infrastructure allows to implement new kinds of
   paint methods like vector based painting.

 - Gradients can now be created, deleted, renamed and edited through
   the PDB.

 - Some changes to plug-ins.

   * Plug-ins can now register the same procedures in multiple places (the
     API to register menu entries has been changed in a backward-compatible 
     fashion).

   * Plug-ins can now optionally register a menu icon.

   * File plug-ins can now register a mime-type.

   * All plug-in dialogs have been reviewed and changed to make them
     comply better with the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.

   * All plug-ins that need to access files use the new GtkFileChooser
     dialog.

   * The obsolete AlienMap and GIcon plug-ins were removed.  AlienMap2
     does everything than AlienMap did, and the GIMP-specific GIcon format
     has not been used by anything for quite some time now.

   * A plug-in to load and save windows icon files has been added.
