The GNU Image Manipulation Program Version 2.1
----------------------------------------------

This is the development branch of The GIMP. Here's where new features
are being added. Somewhen this summer the next stable GIMP release,
GIMP 2.2, will emerge out of this.


Overview of Changes since 2.0
=============================

 - Use new widgets and frameworks provided by GTK+ 2.4; this means
   * use the new GtkFileChooser dialog
   * ported the menus to GtkUIManager, create all core menus from XML
     files at runtime
   * use a global accelerator table in all docks and image windows
   * added replacement widgets based on GtkComboBox for most users of
     GtkOptionMenu (GimpUnitMenu remains to be ported)
   * started to make the order and visibility of tools in the toolbox
     configurable
   * allow to keep toolbox and dock windows above (if the WM supports
     this hint)
 - Plug-ins can now register the same procedures in multiple places,
   the API to register menu entries has been changed in a
   backward-compatible fashion.
 - AlienMap and GIcon plug-ins were removed.
 - A plug-in to load and save windows icon files has been added.
 - Work has begun to make the GIMP user interface comply better with
   the GNOME HIG. This is an ongoing effort and the interface is quite
   inconsistent at the moment.
 - Allow to clear the undo history.
 - Allow pixels as image unit; simplifies handling of units.
