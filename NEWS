GIMP 1.3 is the development branch of The GIMP. Here's where the
development takes place on the road to the next stable release
dubbed GIMP 1.4.

Version 1.3.0
=============
- Ported almost everything to the GTK+-2.0 API. Check the file INSTALL
  to learn what libraries we require in detail.
- Cleaned up the core a lot. The app directory is now broken up into
  subdirectories that define subsystems with defined relationships.
- Seperated GUI from core functionality in lots of places.
- Rewrote large parts of the user interface in a more generic way.
- Started to rewrite the text tool (completely broken at the moment)
_ Lots of stuff not mentioned here. See the file ChangeLog for more info.
