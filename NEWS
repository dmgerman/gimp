            The GNU Image Manipulation Program Version 1.3
                          A Colorspace Odyssey


GIMP 1.3 is the development branch of The GIMP. Here's where the
development takes place on the road to the next stable release
dubbed GIMP 1.4.


Overview of Changes in GIMP 1.3.0
=================================

- Ported almost everything to the GTK+-2.0 API. Check the file INSTALL
  to learn what libraries we require in detail.
- Cleaned up the core a lot. The app directory is now broken up into
  subdirectories that define subsystems with defined dependencies.
- Seperated GUI from core functionality in almost all places.
- The core object system does not depend on GTK+ any more.
- Rewrote large parts of the user interface in a more generic way.
- Started to rewrite the text tool (completely broken at the moment)
- Lots of changes in the tool system. All paint tool PDB wrappers are
  broken at the moment.
- Split up libgimp and libgimpui in a bunch of smaller utility
  libraries for plug-ins and the core.
- Removed GIMP 1.0 compatibility wrappers.
- Lots of stuff not mentioned here. See the file ChangeLog for more info.
