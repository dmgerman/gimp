Overview of Changes in GIMP 1.3.0
=================================

- Ported almost everything to the GTK+-2.0 API. Check the file INSTALL
  to learn what libraries we require in detail.
- Cleaned up the core a lot. The app directory is now broken up into
  subdirectories that define subsystems with defined dependencies.
- Seperated GUI from core functionality in almost all places.
- The core object system does not depend on GTK+ any more.
- Rewrote large parts of the user interface in a more generic way.
- Started to rewrite the text tool (completely broken at the moment)
- Lots of changes in the tool system. All paint tool PDB wrappers are
  broken at the moment.
- Split up libgimp and libgimpui in a bunch of smaller utility
  libraries for plug-ins and the core.
- Removed GIMP 1.0 compatibility wrappers.
- Lots of stuff not mentioned here. See the file ChangeLog for more info.
