    The Brush Editor dialog allows you to make alterations to brushes.
    At the top of the dialog, you can see the name of the brush (a new
    brush will be called "Untitled"). This name can be edited to
    change the brush name. If you choose a name which is the same as
    another brush, Gimp will suffix "#<emphasis>x</emphasis>".
    <footnote> <para> where <emphasis>x</emphasis> is a number.

    Below the title, you can see a preview of how the final brush will
    look. If you resize the brush to a size larger than the preview
    area, the preveiw will be scaled, and the scale factor shown below
    it as a ratio, such as 2:1 for 50% zoomed out.

      The remainder of the dialog controls how the brush will look.
      The Radius controls the distance from the center of the brush to
      the furthest edge in pixels. The maximum radius of a brush is
      100 pixels.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The Hardness slider controls how much the brush fades towards
      it's edges. A value closer to 1 will give a sharp edge and
      closer to 0 will give a fuzzy, blurred effect.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The Aspect Ratio defines the vertical diameter as a ratio
      against the horizontal diameter. A value of 1.0 will give a
      round brush since this means that the horizontal diameter is 1x
      the vertical.  The maximum value is 20, where the horizontal
      diameter is 20x the vertical, which gives a very squashed
      elliptical brush.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The final setting is Angle which is used when the aspect ratio
      is more than 1.0. The angle can be between 0 and 180 degrees,
      measured counterclockwise.
