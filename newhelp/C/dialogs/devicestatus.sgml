  <title>The Device Status Dialog</title>
  
  <para>
    The Device dialog will show you the status of your input devices.
    This is (only) useful if you have a drawing tablet. If you do have
    then you will be able to see and adjust what tool, color, brush,
    pattern and gradient you have assigned to your different pens (i.e
    input devices).
  </para>
  
  <para>
    To alter the context each device has, you simply drag and drop
    brushes, tools etc. with the <mousebutton> middle </mousebutton>
    mouse button from the respective dialog (e.g you drag and drop
    tools from the tool box).
  </para>
  
  <para>
    It can be very wise to set up a standard context for all your
    tools and save it (and disable saving of device status on exit in
    the preference dialog). By doing so you will always have the same
    settings of the tools each time you start <application> GIMP
    </application>.
