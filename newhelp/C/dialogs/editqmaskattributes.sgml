    The fill opacity is used to set how much of the underlying image
    is visible when you work with quick mask that you later on will
    turn into a selection. If you set it too high you will not be able
    to see the image underneath.  Use a color that allows a good
    visibility of the underlying image (i.e. not red if it is a red
    image).
