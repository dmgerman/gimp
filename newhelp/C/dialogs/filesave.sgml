  <title> File Save or Save As </title>
  
  <para>
    File Save lets you save your file either by its extension e.g.
    save a file.xcf as an <acronym> XCF </acronym> image. The
    <acronym> XCF </acronym> file format is <application> GIMP
    </application>'s native file format and is the preferred format to
    save all your images in.
      
    <note> 
      <para>
	You can of course save as <acronym> TIFF </acronym> ,
	<acronym> JPEG </acronym> , or one of the other available
	formats, but all the specific <application> GIMP
	</application> image information will be lost (i.e the
	information about layers, channels, parasites, etc).
      </para>
    </note>
  </para>

  <para>
    When you save an image in a non-<application> GIMP </application>
    format (i.e not as a XCF or XJT image) you might get the
    opportunity to export it. By exporting it you will be sure of
    getting all the visual image information saved in the non-native
    format.  (Exporting will, for example, flatten an image to be
    saved as .jpg)  Ignoring the suggestion to export runs the risk of
    losing valuable image information such as nonactive layers.

    The save dialog works like any other file dialog, but you also
    have two means of fast navigation. Tab completion, e.g if you have
    a directory <filename> /gimp </filename> and the save dialog is
    currently with in the <filename> /home/gimp </filename> directly.
    Then you only have to type <userinput> /gi </userinput> and hit
    TAB and the name will be completed (It works just like TAB
    completion in <application> bash </application> or <application>
    tch </application> shells in UNIX or if you have turned it on as
    TAB completion in the <application> cms </application> in
    <application> NT </application>). You also have a drop down
    directory menu which will enable you to quickly move up in the
    directory hierarchy.
  </para>
    
  <para>
    You can also create directories and  delete or rename files in the
    save dialog. Creating directories is very handy since often end up
    doing a new image for a new project before you made a directory to
    contain images for the project. Sometimes it is necessary to step
    up and down once in the directory hierarchy before <application>
    GIMP </application> will be able to see the new directory.
