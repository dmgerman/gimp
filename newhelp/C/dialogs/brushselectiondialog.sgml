  <title> The Brush Selection Dialog </title>

  <para>
    It's in this dialog you choose what brush you want to use, and the
    settings you want to apply to the brush. The dialog displays all
    the available brushes.  You may also notice some of <application>
    <acronym> GIMP </acronym> </application>s special features, like
    colored brushes (pixmap brushes), brushes with a red triangle in
    the right corner a so called "Image Hose" brush, brushes with
    artistic text, little flourishes or do odles, etc.
  </para>

  <para>
    All of those brushes are relatively easy to create in Gimp and
    save them in the appropriate format. Gimp also provides you with a
    <ulink url="brush_editor.html" type="http"> brush editor </ulink>
    where you can create and edit brushes. <footnote> <para> you can
    only edit brushes that are created in the brush editor </para>

  <sect2 id="Preview">
    <title>  Preview and Brush Information </title>
    
    <para>
      You will see that some of the brushes in the dialog has a little
      + sign.  The + sign is indicating that the brush preview is
      scaled to fit, i.e.  the brush is larger in reality. To view the
      real size of the brush, click and hold on the brush square and
      the real size brush will appear (and disappear when you release
      the mouse).
    </para>

    <para>
      When you choose a brush the name and the size of the brush will
      appear in the brush dialog. The brush size is measured in
      pixels.

      Spacing is the distance between your brush marks. If you set the
      spacing to 100, the brushmarks will be like a bed of pearls.  If
      you set the spacing to zero, the brushmarks will create a solid,
      brush-shaped line. If the spacing is higher than 100 the
      brushmarks will form a dotted line.  <note> <para> It is mostly
      not useful to set the spacing to zero since the brush (most
      notably fuzzy ones) will look unnatural. </para> </note>

  <sect2 id="pixmapbrushes">
    <title> Pixmap Brushes </title>

    <para>
      Pixmap brushes are small images that can be used as a brush.
      Since the brush is a image you can't alter it's color, i.e the
      color setting in the toolbox will not apply to this image.
      <note> <para> If you use color as a pressure sensitivity when
      you paint you will be able to change the color of the pixmap
      brush.  For information how to create and save a Pixmap Brush
      please see the <ulink url="../save/filters/gpb.html"
