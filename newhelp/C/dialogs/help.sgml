  <title> Help Page for Help </title>
  <para>
    Well what about a help page for a help. In the Help Dialog, if you
    are using the <application> GIMP </application> <application>
    helpbrowser </application>,  you will see three tabs -- <guilabel>
    Index </guilabel>, <guilabel> Contents </guilabel>, and the
    current help page (this is the tab where you are reading this
    text).
  </para>
      
  <para>
    In the <guilabel> Index </guilabel> tab you will find links to
    most of the subjects in the <application> GIMP </application> help
    system. In the <guilabel> Contents </guilabel> tab you will find
    links built up of a hierarchy. This will enable you to find all
    help pages about a special area of <application> GIMP
    </application> (e.g all help pages about selections).
  </para>
  
  <para>
    You can invoke the help system either by pressing F1 in a
    <application> GIMP </application> dialog or window or by pressing
    F1 when a menu item is active i.e. go into a menu and hover over a
    menuentry e.g <guilabel> Grow </guilabel>, now press F1 and the
    help page for Grow will be loaded into the <application>
    helpbrowser </application>.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    If you press Shift-F1 then you will get a <guiicon> ? </guiicon>
    sign which you can point and click on buttons and other items in
    <application> GIMP </application>. If the item has help available,
    the help document is loaded into the <application> helpbrowser
    </application>.
