  <title> New Image </title>
  
  <para>
    File New will create a new <application> GIMP </application> image
    in either <acronym> RGB </acronym> (color) or Grayscale mode. You
    can't create an Indexed image since <application> GIMP
    </application> will not know which colors your palette should
    have. Working in Indexed mode is usually not a good choice.
    Instead work in <acronym> RGB </acronym> and convert to Indexed
    just before saving the image.

    How to create a new image:
    
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term> Set the resolution </term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The resolution is how many pixels per length unit you want
	    for your image. The default 72ppi (72 pixels/inch) is good
	    if you want to create web graphics (you can alter the
	    default value in the preferences dialog). However if you
	    going to print your image you will probably need a lot
	    more than 72ppi. You have several choices about how you
	    want to measure the resolution pixels per inch, mm, points
	    or picas (there is also an option which will bring up a
	    dialog with even more choices). We suggest that you stick
	    to ppi since that the most common format when you are
	    dealing with images. You can have different X and Y
	    resolutions by unlinking the chain but that is not
	    recommended.

      <varlistentry>
        <term> Set the size </term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You have two options. Either you can set it directly in
	    pixels in the top frame or in a real world unit in the
	    middle frame. If you are working with web graphics we
	    suggest that you deal with pixels directly. If you going
	    to print your image then setting in a real world unit is
	    the preferred.

	    Foreground takes the currently active foreground color

	    background color from the toolbox White sets the fill
	    color to white no matter what the toolbox colors are
	    Transparent prevents the image from filling. Instead you
	    will get a totally "empty" image to start with.
