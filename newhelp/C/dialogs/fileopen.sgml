    Open dialog is where you can load images into the <application>
    GIMP </application> for viewing or editing. The left hand window
    shows the directories and the right hand window shows the files in
    the selected directory. To open a file, select it in the files
    listing, then choose what file type it is unless the file has an
    extension which defines it's filetype (such as .xcf) in which case
    you can select <guibutton> Automatic </guibutton> and
    <application> GIMP </application> will open the file in that
    format.  Alternatively, you can force <application> GIMP
    </application> to open the file as a specific format by choosing
    one of the other options in the drop down list.

    Some images have a preview associated with them so you can see
    what the image is before opening it. This is particularly useful
    for larger images where opening the full image will take a while.
    If an image doesn't have a preview, you can click <guibutton>
    Generate Preview </guibutton> to create one. This preview image is
    stored in a sub-directory of the current one called <filename>
    .xvpics </filename>. This preview image will be used in future
    when using the open dialog. Clicking <guibutton> OK </guibutton>
    opens the image with the selected settings, <guibutton> Cancel
    </guibutton> aborts.

    A useful feature of the Load Image dialog is autocompletion of
    filenames. Type the first few letters of the filename and press
    the Tab key. <application> GIMP </application> will complete as
    much of the filename as is uniquely defined by what has already
    been typed. The right side of the dialog will display all files
    that match the letters in the selection box. You can then type
    more letters and press Tab again to update the window.

    You can load multiple images by pressing Shift key and clicking on
    each file you want to open.
