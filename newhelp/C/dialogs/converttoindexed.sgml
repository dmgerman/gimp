  <title> Indexed Mode </title>

  <para>
    This mode enables you to convert RGB or Grayscale Images to
    Indexed images. An Indexed image is an image which only has the
    colors specified in its color palette which is present in the
    image file. The maximum number of colors in an Indexed image is
    256. If you want to make transparent GIF images then you can only
    have a maximum of 255 colors since the last color (i.e color
    number 256) will be used to determine if the pixel is opaque or
    transparent.

	    This is most of the time the best options to create a

	    create a color palette suitable for the image. You can
	    specify the amount of colors that you want to have in your
	    index image but remember that you can't have more than 255
	    colors if are about to create an indexed image with
	    transparency.

	    If you want to use a predefined palette you have to use
	    this option. You then choose your palette from the drop
	    down menu. By default it's Web palette. The Web palette is
	    the palette used by web browsers such as Netscape. This
	    will help you create web safe indexed images images.
	    <note>
	      <para>
		There is some debate if you should index against the
		Web palette or not.

	    Remove unused colors from final palette: If the palette

  <sect2 id="dithering">
    <title> Dithering </title>
    <para>
      An Indexed image can only be built up of a maximum of 256
      colors. Most of the time this is quite limited and you will not
      be able to have all the colors in your image represented in this
      limited color space. The image will look like it is built up of
      "bands" or "color areas". To make Indexed images look better you
      can dither them. This means that two or more colors are mixed to
      mimic the missing color. The disadvantage is that the image can
      look like it's built up of "dots".

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Use this option when you are dealing with animations
	      such as gif animations. The problem with dithering in
	      animations is that the dithering will not be constant.
	      If you choose positioned dithering instead, the
	      dithering in constant areas will remain constant across
	      your frames. It is not as good as Floyd Steinberg
	      dithering, but is better than no dithering at all.

	    <para>
	      With normal Floyd Steinberg dithering, you may
	      experience too much color bleeding. This is very visible
	      when you index gradients, causing an unnatural look. If
	      you encounter this effect, it is advisable to use this
	      option (i.e Floyd Steinberg dithering reduced colour
	      bleeding).

	      This is the best option to use when you are indexing
	      images. It's only in special cases that you will use the
	      other dithering methods available.

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Indexed images only have one transparency mode either it
	      is off (the pixel is totally solid) or on (the pixel is
	      totally transparent). This makes it very difficult to
	      index images with smooth transitions from opaque to
	      transparent. When you enable dithering of transparency,
	      Gimp will try to mimic the smooth transition by
	      dithering pixels on and off.
