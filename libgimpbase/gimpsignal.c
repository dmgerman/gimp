comment|/**  * gimp_signal_private:  * @signum: Selects signal to be handled see man 5 signal (or man 7 signal)  * @handler: Handler that maps to signum. Invoked by O/S.  *           Handler gets signal that caused invocation. Corresponds  *           to the @sa_handler field of the @sigaction struct.  * @flags: Preferences. OR'ed SA_&lt;xxx&gt;. See man sigaction. Corresponds  *         to the @sa_flags field of the @sigaction struct.  *  * This function furnishes a workalike for signal(2) but  * which internally invokes sigaction(2) after certain  * sa_flags are set; these primarily to ensure restarting  * of interrupted system calls. See sigaction(2)  It is a  * aid to transition and not new development: that effort  * should employ sigaction directly. [gosgood 18.04.2000]  *  * Cause @handler to be run when @signum is delivered.  We  * use sigaction(2) rather than signal(2) so that we can control the  * signal handler's environment completely via @flags: some signal(2)  * implementations differ in their sematics, so we need to nail down  * exactly what we want. [austin 06.04.2000]  *  * Returns: A reference to the signal handling function which was  *          active before the call to gimp_signal_private().  */
