The GIMP Dynamic Text plug-in "todo"-list:
==========================================

* fix the problem with the ascent value while rendering text
* allow only valid sizes for non scalable fonts (use gtkfontselection)
* add customizable tab expansion
* disable antialias for non scalable fonts
* text save
* charmap window must handle fonts with more than 256 chars.
* behave more like an editor with font, color and justifcation applied on a
  selected area only
* a list of customizable pre-sets (useful for logos)
* internal text rendering routine
* transformation window: text path, perspective, color gradients, 3d
* special effects, like customizable shadow or auto-call of scripts after the
  text rendered
* autoconf stuff

If there's anything you would like to add, feel free
to send me any suggestions for new stuff or improvements.
