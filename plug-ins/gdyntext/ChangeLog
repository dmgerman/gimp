Aug 14 2000
  * MADE 1.5.2 RELEASE
  * Merged with 1.5.0 from gimp CVS.
Aug 12 2000
  * MADE 1.5.1 RELEASE
  * Fixed a "bug" that avoided setting the plugin values at the first startup
    (mainly the color value, and the antialias erroneously disabled).
Jun 25 2000
  * MADE 1.5.0 RELEASE
  * Requires gimp 1.1.24+.
  * Updated parasites support for gimp-1.1.24.
  * Plugged back compatibility load function.
  * Fixed a bug with the point based font size rendering: it was erroneously
    divided by 10 so the resulting font was smaller! This bug affected even
    previous releases of gDynText (1.4.3, 1.4.4 and probably older ones).
  * Now gDynText restores the setting of the last call.
Jun 04 2000
  * MADE 1.5.0-RC3 RELEASE
  * User interface restyled and updated.
  * Added layer alignment control.
May 31 2000
  * MADE 1.5.0-RC2 RELEASE
  * Requires GIMP 1.1.20+ and will not work anymore with 1.0.x series.
  * Updated the PDB interface.
  * The font_selection widget is finally well integrated with the
    gtk_font_selection one.
  * Updated gimp_edit_clear and gimp_rotate PDB calls.
  * Replaced the gimp_text and gimp_text_get_extents PDB calls with
    gimp_text_fontname and gimp_text_get_extents_fontname.
  * Removed any compatibilty code with previous releases of gDynText
    (temporally, I hope to bring back them in the final version).
May 27 2000
  * MADE 1.5.0-RC1 RELEASE
  * Finally gDynText uses internally the standard gtk_font_selection widget.
    Now it should behave as (I hope better than) the standard Text Tool.
  * Support for different font encodings.
  * Some code was merged from the gdyntext shipped with gimp-1.1.22.
Dec 29 1999
  * MADE 1.4.4 RELEASE
  * Some code was merged from the gdyntext shipped with gimp-1.1.14.
  * The message window reporting that "Current layer isn't a GDynText layer"
    was disabled, however the message is still printed to stdout.
  * Fixed an undo bug. The gtd layer changes and the related parasites now are
    undoable together in one step.
Mar 02 1999
  * MADE 1.4.3 RELEASE
  * Fixed the "run with last val" behaviour with the Apply button.
  * The CharMap window now shows also ascii values from 0 to 32.
  * Optimized a bit the font_selector widget. However gtk+ 1.2.1 seems to have
    problems in displaying huge number of items (>= 3000) into gtk_lists and
    consequently in gtk_combos used by font_selector.
  * Code cleaned, removed some internal functions, bugs and memory leaks.
  * gtk+ 1.0 and glib 1.0 compatibility is probably broken, now gimp >= 1.0.4
    is required for running GDynText.
  * Applied a patch for upcoming gimp 1.1.5.
Apr 25 1999
  * MADE 1.4.2 RELEASE
  * Added the "Apply" button.
Apr 15 1999
  * MADE 1.4.1 RELEASE
  * Fixed garbaged layer bug when there is an active selection.
Apr 14 1999
  * MADE 1.4.0 RELEASE
  * Added customizable line spacing.
Mar 17 1999
  * MADE 1.3.1 RELEASE
  * With GIMP 1.1 now uses only one parasite called "gdyntext-parasite".
Feb 20 1999
  * MADE 1.3.0 RELEASE
  * With GIMP 1.1 now uses parasites. You can force layer renaming for
    compatibility with GIMP 1.0 (that hasn't parasites) by holding the
    Shift key while pressing the "Ok" button.
  * Some changes into the UI code.
  * Triggered strings for NLS support (libgimp/gimpintl.h).
  * If you use GTK+ 1.1 you may need GTK+ 1.1.16 or better for correct button
    resizing in the CharMap window.
  * Updated sample scripts:
      gdyntext_test.scm   -> for GIMP 1.0
      gdyntext_test11.scm -> for GIMP 1.1
Jan 21 1999
  * MADE 1.2.1 RELEASE
  * Fixed the problem with removed leading spaces.
Jan 16 1999
  * MADE 1.2 RELEASE
  * Text loading from file.
  * Ui code reorganization.
  * Some internal changes for better and cleaner support for gimp 1.1 and
    gtk 1.1 (changed GIMP11 ifdef to GTK_HAVE_FEATURES_1_1_12 and
    GIMP_HAVE_PARASITES).
Jan 12 1999
  * MADE 1.1 RELEASE
  * Applied some changes for working with gimp 1.1 and gtk+ 1.1.
  * New charmap window.
Jan 08 1999
  * MADE 1.0 RELEASE
  * Now the plug-in is undoable (except the modified layer name, GIMP fault).
  * Corrected a bug that always create a new GRAYA_IMAGE layer if called on
    a layer mask.
  * PDB support is ok, now also returns the layer_id.
  * Sample Script-Fu script added to the archive.
  * Now restores the font preview state from the previous call.
Jan 07 1999
  * MADE 0.9 RELEASE
  * Extended the font preview to the text area widget.
  * The vertical scrollbar for the text area widget now works.
  * Added some new error checks and a message window.
  * Gui source code cleanup and re-organization.
Dec 29 1998
  * MADE 0.8 RELEASE
  * Allows changing text font weight, slant and spacing.
  * Fixed a bug that made gdyntext crash while rendering if the last line
    isn't \n terminated.
  * Fixed the plug-in RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS behaviour, now it re-apply on the
    current layer (or a new one if the current hasn't alpha channel).
  * Updated the PDB support, however it's still buggy ...
Dec 27 1998
  * MADE 0.7 RELEASE
  * Text font preview.
  * Text rotation.
