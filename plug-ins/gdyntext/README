Intro
=====

GIMP Dynamic Text is a GIMP plug-in that works like the text tool but
allows you writing multi-line text and made you able of modifying it later
as you want (text/font/font size/color/...).
However I hope that a feature like this will be available on GIMP 1.2 as a
standard tool.

GIMP version required:    1.0 or 1.1 (see compiling for GIMP 1.1 below)
Plug-in menu path:        <Image>/Filters/Render/Dynamic Text
PDB function:             plug-in-dynamic-text
Suggested hotkey:         Alt+T

This is my second plug-in, the first was an xvpict loader now embedded into
the Guash plug-in of Shuji Narazaki.
It's rather far from being a complete work and I've just starded in playing
with GTK+ ... it's a really powerful but also a complex toolkit for a
programmer that had used only Java AWT for opening windows on X11!

Compiling for GIMP 1.0
======================

Simply run 'make install'. Optionally if something goes wrong you could edit
the shipped Makefile.

Compiling for GIMP 1.1
======================

You must edit the Makefile and change GIMP11BIN in order to reflect the path
where the GIMP 1.1 binary and gimptool are installed then you could run
'make install11'.

* Glade, the GTK+ gui builder, was a good starting point for learning how to
  write GTK+ applications.
* The "Writing a GIMP plug-in" tutorial written by Kevin Turner help me in
  figuring better how the GIMP plug-in system works.
* I've taken few lines of code for the preview initialization from the bumpmap
  plug-in written by Federico Mena Quintero and Jens Lautenbacher.
