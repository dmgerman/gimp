- external converter, to build stand-alone plugins
- converter for "compiled" plug-ins, to keep author-information
- a simple parser for <name>.txt files, for "copyright:" or "author:" lines.
- the pdb-interface
- use some features of libgck
- optimize parser + lexer, error-correction
- entryfields next to the sliders, to enter values directly
- clean up internal structúre -> as it will be a base for a lot of plug-ins,
  I should spend some time on code-quality and performance.
- "About" dialog box.
- RGB -> YUV conversion, to initialise i,u and v with correct values.
- as sin, cos and tan are only used on a limited set of values, I could use
precalculated tables for them.
