There was a comment, that there was already a "math plugin". I hope,
everyone notices, that this is mainly directed to compatibility with
EXISTING filters of another program, and not to be the "general and best
solution for user filters".
I think a macro-recorder, that produces script-fu or C code would create
much better results.
