GCK changes (post 0.02)
=======================

	* plug-ins/libgck/gck/gckui.c (gck_application_window_new): 
	Removed 2 obsolete statements causing OS/2 to crash.
	The code was trying to update a static const structure!
	
-> 1.0.0

* Fixed RINT stuff (Quartic)
* Kicked out GckNotebook.c/.h
* Fixed refcounting problems and automake things.
* Libtoolized to libtool 1.1

-> 0.1.4

* Fixed some .deps sillyness, revised to 0.99.13

-> 0.1.3

* Cleanup. Revised to GTK/GIMP 0.99.11.

-> 0.1.2

* GckColorSelectionWindow, GckPixmap and GckToolTipsWidget replaced with
  GDK/GTK counterparts and is thus removed. GckNotebook is also a potentional
  candidate for removal. Revised to new GTK API (as for GIMP 0.99.10). Examples
  removed until revised. Added autoconf, automake and libtool stuff.

-> 0.1.1

* Fixed bugs, added option_menu example. Changed OpenGL sample prog. to
  respond to window size changes. Fixed a serious bug in the notebook.

-> 0.1.0

* Changed all UI functions to reflect the new GDK/GTK API. Too many changes
  to specify here.

-> 0.0.7:

* Added gck_gc_set_bacground() and gck_gc_set_foreground() to set a
  GdkGC back/foreground color directly using RGB values.
* Fixed a silly bug in the 8-bit FS dither; forgot to compute the
  invmap tables..
* Added gck_pixmap widget and support for reading XPM files into a GdkImage
  or GdkPixmap (doesn't use the xpm library).
* Made gck_pushbutton_pixmap_new() function. Guess what it does :)

-> 0.0.6:

* Changed gck_entryfield_new(); it now takes a double as the initial
  value, and not a pointer to a double. The function won't fiddle with the
  user_data field of the observer, but leaves this to the user.
* Added gck_tooltipswidget. Handy a-la MS and Netscape widget tips. Added a
  small example on its usage.
* Changed the behaviour of gdk_rgb_to_gdkcolor() a bit. The returned
  pointer to the GdkColor structure is now malloced, so remember to free it
  when you're done with it.
* Added two more gtk widgets; gck_menu and gck_menu_bar. See the examples.
* Added gck_list_box widget - convenience routines for handling lists. Included
  a couple of examples to show it off.

-> 0.0.5:

* Added some stuff to the include files so C++ don't choke on them
* Added additional debug stuff (g_assert() and g_enter/leave_function())
* Changed a couple of UI functions to include a user_data field. This will
  set the user_data field of the widget(s) and can be retrieved with the
  gtk_widget_get_user_data() call - very useful when dealing with (static)
  callbacks in C++.
* All gckui functions will now accept NULL containers; be sure to call
  gck_auto_show(FALSE) first.
* GNU-ified the sources with GNU indent.

-> 0.0.4:

* More notebook stuff; nicer look, page-tabs positioning + other things.
* Fixed gck_optionmenu_new(); didn't make label widget if name!=NULL.

-> 0.0.3:

* Fixed a couple of bugs, cleaned up things a bit. Added first
  version of the notebook (see ./examples/misc/notebook.c).
* Started fooling around with docs.
* First public release
