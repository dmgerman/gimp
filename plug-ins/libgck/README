The General Drawing Kit (GDK), The General Toolkit (GTK) and The GIMP was
developed and is (C) by Peter Mattis and Spencer Kimball. You can contact
them at gimp@xcf.berkeley.edu, or visit the GIMP home page which is located
at http://www.gimp.org

There's additional GIMP stuff on my home page:

Description
===========

Short: This library is a collection of more or less useful stuff for GIMP plug-in
writers and/or users of GDK/GTK.

I must point out that this is not an attempt to enhance GDK|GTK in any way; there's nothing
in it that can't be done using GDK|GTK alone. IMHO, improvements or new functionality
should be integrated with GDK|GTK, not added on top.

Here's a quick description of each file;

./gck/
gckcommon.c :     Common variables and defines
gckmath.c :       Useful math routines not in math.h
gckcolor.c :      Conversion routines from raw RGB(A) to GdkImage (RGB to
                  32/24/16/8 bpp). Basic RGB operations (add,sub etc.), super-
                  sampling routines, bilinear interpolation and other color-related
                  functions (color-space conversions etc.)
gckui.c :         Convenience routines for creating various UI elements
                  (dialogs, buttons, sliders, container-boxes etc.). Almost like
                  the libgimp calls, but with more options and the possibility to
                  mix it with other GDK|GTK things if you want
gckcolor_select : Source for the GCK color select window
gckvector.c :     2d and 3d vector operations (2d->3d, 3d->2d, add, sub, cross-product,
                  rotate etc.)

./examples/misc/* :   Various small examples of how to use the library
./examples/gimp/* :   GIMP plug-in examples.
./examples/opengl/* : Examples of binding OpenGL and GDK/GTK.

Hopefully this will grow with time. The goal is to provide GIMP plug-in writers
and GDK/GTK users with a library to ease the writing of applications and UIs.

Some things may become obsolete as the GIMP/GDK/GTK API evolves, and in the long
run the whole library may be unnecessary. Until I get around to writing some kind
of documentation you'll have to dig around in the sources on your own.

Take a look at the examples and the plug-ins I've written using this library,
and you'll soon get the hang of it. Feel free to modify and/or add new things
to the library, but remember to send me a patch if you do :)

Check out the TODO file for things missing and in the works.

Have fun,

Tom
