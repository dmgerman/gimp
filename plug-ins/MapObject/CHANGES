Changes (post 0.31):
====================

-> 0.31    Merged MapPlane and MapSphere. Added support for non-interactive
           execution (for script-fu).
-> 0.32    Fixed a bug in the bilinear interpolation function. Added "tile" option.
           Added some icons to the material page to illustrate the effects of the
           parameters. I'm not sure they help much.
-> 0.40    Some source/algorithm cleanups, fixed gtk+ object refcounting bugs. Some
           changes to compile with gtk+ 0.99.4.
-> 1.00    First non-beta release. Replaced GckNotebook with GtkNotebook, fixed a few
           annoying bugs. Better support for partial transparency (only filtered
           transparency now, perhaps additive later). Compiles without warnings with
           -Wall and -ansi.
