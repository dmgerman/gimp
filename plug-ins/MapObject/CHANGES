Changes (post 0.31):
====================

-> 0.31  Merged MapPlane and MapSphere. Added support for non-interactive
         execution (for script-fu).
-> 0.32  Fixed a bug in the bilinear interpolation function. Added "tile" option.
         Added some icons to the material page to illustrate the effects of the
         parameters. I'm not sure they help much.
