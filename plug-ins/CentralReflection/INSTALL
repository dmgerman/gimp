-------------------------------------------
 Some code is taken out of other plug-ins
 written by other authors.
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
-------------------------------------------
              INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------
 To install it, you have to edit the
 Makefile (change install-path).
 Afterwards run make. This will compile 
 and install the plug-in in the right 
 directory. Once the new code is installed,
 you can run the GIMP and enjoy the new
 functions and effects it provides.

-------------------------------------------
             REDUCE CODE SIZE
-------------------------------------------
 With this new release 1.04 the size of
 the logo in the about box has been reduced
 in order to make smaller binaries.
 If you find that the plug-in is still
 too big, you can compress the executables
 with the gzexe program (if it is avaiable
 on your system). To do so, change to the
 plug-in directory of the GIMP...
 
   cd /usr/local/lib/gimp/VERSION/plug-ins
 
 ...and execute the command...
 
   gzexe PLUGIN_NAME
   
 ...and remember to remove the uncompres-
 sed binary, which has been renamed to
 PLUGIN_NAME~, by running the command:
 
   rm PLUGIN_NAME~
    
 This will result in a code size of about
 20 kB, which isn't too much IMHO.

                FEEDBACK
------------------------------------------
 I'm interested in any feedback, comments,
 bug-reports, suggestions etc. If you
 have anything you would like to tell 
 me, you can write to cotting@mygale.org.
 Also have a look at the GIMP-section of
 my homepage at www.mygale.org/~cotting.
