-------------------------------------------
 Some code is taken out of other plug-ins
 written by other authors.
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
-------------------------------------------
              INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------
 To install it, you have to edit the
 Makefile (change install-path).
 Afterwards run make. This will compile 
 and install the plug-in in the right 
 directory. Once the new code is installed,
 you can run the GIMP and enjoy the new
 functions and effects it provides.
 
 Note that this plug-in has some sample
 files which must be installed in one of
 the following directories:
 
 ~/.gimp/fractalexplorer
 /usr/local/share/gimp/0.99.XX/fractalexplorer
 
 You can find the sample files in the
 subdirectory fractalexplorer-examples
 of this distribution.
 
 You will have to add the following lines
 to your gimprc file (usually 
 /usr/local/ share/gimp/0.99.XX/gimprc):

    # fractalexplorer directory
    (fractalexplorer-path "${gimp_data_dir}/fractalexplorer:${gimp_dir}/fractalexplorer")

-------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------
             REDUCE CODE SIZE
-------------------------------------------
 If you find that the plug-in is too big, 
 you can compress the executables with the 
 gzexe program (if it is avaiable on your 
 system). To do so, change to the plug-in 
 directory of the GIMP...
 
   cd /usr/local/lib/gimp/VERSION/plug-ins
 
 ...and execute the command...
 
   gzexe PLUGIN_NAME
   
 ...and remember to remove the uncompres-
 sed binary, which has been renamed to
 PLUGIN_NAME~, by running the command:
 
   rm PLUGIN_NAME~
    
 This will result in a code size of about
 50 kB, which isn't too much IMHO.

                FEEDBACK
------------------------------------------
 I'm interested in any feedback, comments,
 bug-reports, suggestions etc. If you
 have anything you would like to tell 
 me, you can write to cotting@mygale.org.
 Also have a look at the GIMP-section of
 my homepage at www.mygale.org/~cotting.

              Thank you and happy GIMPing!
