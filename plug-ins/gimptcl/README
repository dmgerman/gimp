This is the first real release of gimptcl-1.0, distributed in
the FreeBSD gimp-0.99.14 port.

It comes with three sample plug-ins.
 * Consolio, an interactive gimptcl shell
 * pdb-help, an interactive thing for browsing
   the pdb and running procedures
 * stained-glass, a simple (and ugly) plugin for creating
   stained glassy backgrounds.

The ``scripts'' directory contains plug-ins that are real Tcl scripts.

The ``frags'' directory contains tcl procs and fragments that I've used
for testing the interpreter.  I usually just source them from inside
consolio, then call the procs interactively.

Unfortunately I'm not very artistic, so there's no pretty pictures
to look at.
