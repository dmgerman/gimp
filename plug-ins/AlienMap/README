-------------------------------------------
 Some code is taken out of other plug-ins
 written by other authors.
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
-------------------------------------------
              INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------
 To install it,  you have to edit the Make-
 file (change install-path). Afterwards run
 'make'.  This will compile and install the
 plug-in in the right directory.   Once the
 new code is installed, you can run the GIMP
 and enjoy the new functions and effects it
 provides.

         COLOR-CYCLING SCRIPT
-------------------------------------------
 This version of the alienmap plug-in inclu-
 des a script for color cycling animations. 
 It is recommended to start the alienmap 
 plug-in, to fiddle about with the parame-
 ters until you have found optimal start va-
 lues. Then put these values in the appro-
 priate edit fields in the animation dialog.
 Now you can change the values in the alien-
 map plug-in to find interesting end values.
 After you have inserted these new values in
 the corresponding fields of the animation 
 script, you can start the calculation of 
 the animation. The script will create a new
 picture with a layer for each animation 
 frame. With each new frame the start values
 will gradually turn into the specified end
 values, creating an amazing effect of color 
 cycling.

-------------------------------------------
             REDUCE CODE SIZE
-------------------------------------------
 If you find that the plug-in binary is
 too big, you can compress the executables
 with the gzexe program (if it is avaiable
 on your system). To do so, change to the
 plug-in directory of the GIMP...
 
   cd /usr/local/lib/gimp/VERSION/plug-ins
 
 ...and execute the command...
 
   gzexe PLUGIN_NAME
   
 ...and remember to remove the uncompres-
 sed binary, which has been renamed to
 PLUGIN_NAME~, by running the command:
 
   rm PLUGIN_NAME~
    
 This will result in a code size of about
 20 kB, which isn't too much IMHO.

                FEEDBACK
------------------------------------------
 I'm interested in any feedback, comments,
 bug-reports, suggestions etc. If you have
 anything you would like to tell me, you 
 can write to cotting@mygale.org.
 Also have a look at the GIMP-section of
 my homepage at www.mygale.org/~cotting.
