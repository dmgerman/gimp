0.5.0, 12/31/1999:

 * The method used to reconstitute colors is now selectable from the
   dialog.  The operational description used for Alex's method is "add
   white", while the method from 0.4.990720 is called "limit".  Better
   translations are always apprecaite.

0.4.991003:

 * Merged with Alex's update in theory, little changed in practice.

0.4.990721:

 * Button to link strength and brightness adjust.

0.4.990720:

 * Color image handling changed.  No more frost, but red is weird.

0.4.990719:

 * Addition of a user interface to fiddle with the options.

 * gettext support in place (I hope).  Translations appreciated.

 * The coefficients used in the RGB -> luminosity conversion changed.
   See file "color.h"

 * I wrote some help-text to go with the interface.
