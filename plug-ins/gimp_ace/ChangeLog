1999-12-31  Kevin Turner  <kevint@poboxes.com>

	* glace.c, glace.h: Eliminated COLOR_CLASSIC...  it's not smart
	enough to survive.

	* glace.c (Glace_Output): Changed COLOR_LUMIN to use the
	coefficients from color.h to compute Y.  This is more consistant
	with the decomposition in gimp_ace.c (SeperateChannels).

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 0.5.0.

	* dialog.c (ace_dialog): use option menu for color method, not
	radio buttons.

1999-12-30  Kevin Turner  <kevint@poboxes.com>

	* glace.c (Glace_Output): Color method now configurable at runtime
	instead of compile-time #ifdefs.

	* gimp_ace.c (SeperateChannels): The color space in which channels
	are seperated now depends on color_method.

	* glace.h: put back the RGB image pointers for use with other
	color methods

	* gimp_ace.c (acevals =): Added color_method member to initializer.

	* dialog.c (radio_callback): new function
	(ace_dialog): add radio buttons for selecting color_method.

	* glace.h (Glace_CfgInfo): added enum type Glace_ColorMethods, and
	added member colorMethod to Glace_CfgInfo struct.

	* gimp_ace.h: include glace.h for Glace_ColorMethods, add
	color_method to AceValues struct.

	* glace.c (Glace_FillTableForNotFilt): merge some casting changes
	from Alex

	* gimp_ace.c (query): Change menu path.

	* glace.c, glace.h: Merged with Alex's "ace-not-gimp.zip" of 27-Sep-99
	That just means sifting in the #ifdefs...  Still TODO is to take a
	good look at Glace_Output again and merge for real.

1999-07-21  Kevin Turner  <kevint@poboxes.com>

	* dialog.c (ace_dialog_new): change asprintf to g_strdup_printf
		(ace_dialog): Add toggle to link strength and bradj values
	* gimp_ace.c, gimp_ace.h: add link boolean to AceValues

1999-07-20  Kevin Turner  <kevint@poboxes.com>

	* glace.c (Glace_Output): Change the color output routine to use a
 	Yxy chromacity system.
	
	* color.h: Add constants for RGB <-> XYZ conversion matricies.
	
	* gimp_ace.c (SeperateChannels): Seperation of rgb color to xy
 	chromathings is now done here, not in GlaceOutput.  This means we
 	don't seperate out RGB channels into seperate buffers, but fill in
 	two buffers for x and y.  The luminosity buffer (the one which
 	gets operated on) is handled the same way as previously.

	* glace.h: {R,G,B}Ptr is gone, replaced by C{x,y}Ptr
	
1999-07-19  Kevin Turner  <kevint@poboxes.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: first attempt at auto{make,conf}

	* gimp_ace.c (do_ace): implement configurability options with
 	acevals to cfgInfoPtr.
			(run): Add switch(run_mode) to call interactive
 	interface, etc.

	* dialog.c: new file
