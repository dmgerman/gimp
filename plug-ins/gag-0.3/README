 I really have to write here something... later :-)
 I am really sorry for my english... - anybody want to write tutorial and docs?

FAQs & FAAs:

Q) How to compile?  
A) I expect that you know (or find) the answer to this question - well, it's
developers version.. Do not expect too much from me!  For now you must have
sizeof(double)==8 (for xor, or and and) - I fix this later.

Q) How to install GAG-plug-in for one user?
A) Copy gag-plugin binary to your local plug-in directory (for example ~/.gimp/
   plug-ins/), gag-library to ~/.gimp/gag-library and then set gag-library in
   gimprc file (ie add following line

     (gag-library "${gimp_dir}/gag-library"} 

Q) How to install GAG-plug-in for all users?
A) It is similar to installing GAG-plug-in for one user - also do not forget to
   change "user_install" script - so all users have own copy of gag-library
 
Q) Hey, I can not do anything in GAG!  
A) Feel adventurous! Do experiments! Click with mouse on one of nine
pools. Right button of mouse! 

Q) I expected much more from free software than "Feel adventurous"!  
A) Ok, ok. Generate one or more random individual (or specify them by hand with
expression. Be careful, expressions have scheme-like syntax). Then set weight -
weight means how much you like such picture (set higher value of weight for
pictures which you prefere...) Finally press button `New generation'. That's
all.

Q) Supported functions?
A) See expressions.tmpl

Q) Why GAG?
A) I really do not know...

Q) Algorithms?
A) GAG uses genetic algorithms - for more info about them see

      http://www.aracnet.com/~wwir/NovaGenetica/

   Usage of genetic algorithms in task of generating nice pictures was firstly
described in:

	Karl Sims: Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics, SIGGRAPH 1991
	(Computer Graphics, vol 25, num 4, pages 319-328)

Q) Some examples of evolved expressions?
A) [simple but nice]
(-
  (cos
    (x
    )
  )
  (abs
    (bw-noise-xy (x) (y)
    )
  )
)     

[for more examples see GAG library]

Q) Is GAG free?
A) Of course - it is distributed under GNU General Public License (see
http://www.gnu.org). All users are encouraged to enhance current code and send
improvements to author. (Also please send me any your comment, nice picture,
bug, constructive critique,...)
