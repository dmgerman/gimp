.SH NAME
escputil - maintain Epson Stylus inkjet printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B escputil [\-P printer \| \-r device] [\-m model] [\-u]
[\-c \| \-n | \-a \| \-i] [\-q]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIescputil\fP is a command line utility to perform various
maintenance tasks on Epson Stylus inkjet printers.  These tasks
include head alignment, head cleaning, nozzle check, printer
identification, and retrieval of ink level from the printer.

.SH OPTIONS
.l 
\fIescputil\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-P, \-\-printer-name \fI<printer>\fP
Specify the name of the printer to operate on.
Default is the default system printer.
.TP 8
.B \-r, \-\-raw-device \fI<device>\fP
Specify the name of the device to write to directly
rather than going through a printer queue. You must use this (rather
than specifying a printer) when retrieving ink levels or identifying
the printer, or if you wish to perform head alignment without
specifying the printer model.
.TP 8
.B \-c, \-\-clean-head
Clean the print head.  This can also be performed from the printer
front panel.
.TP 8
.B \-n, \-\-nozzle-check
Print a nozzle test pattern.  Dirty or clogged nozzles will show as
gaps in the pattern.  If you see any gaps, you should run a
head cleaning pass or two.
.TP 8
.B \-a, \-\-align-head
Align the print head.  CAUTION: Misuse of this utility may result in
poor print quality and/or damage to the printer.  You must either
specify the printer model with the \-m option, or use the raw printer
device to allow escputil to detect the printer model.
.TP 8
.B \-i, \-\-ink-level     
Obtain the ink level from the printer.  This requires
read/write access to the raw printer device.
.TP 8
.B \-d, \-\-identify
Query the printer for make and model information.
This requires read/write access to the raw printer
device.
.TP 8
.B \-u 
The printer is connected via USB.
.TP 8
.B  \-h, \-\-help
Display a list of all commandline options.
.TP 8
.B \-q, \-\-quiet         
Suppress the banner.
.TP 8
.B \-m <model>
Specify the precise printer model for head alignment.

.SH BUGS

.PP
USB-connected printers sometimes fail to identify or return ink
levels.  You may have to repeat the command.  This is probably a
timing issue in escputil, not a flaw in the printer.

.PP
Anything requiring bidirectional communication with the printer
(identify, ink levels, or head alignment without specifying the
printer model) requires read/write access to the printer port (for
example /dev/lp0).  This may require these operations to be performed
as root.

.PP
If the printer is performing self-test or head cleaning on power
up, the identify and ink level commands will time out, although the
printer successfully receives the command.  The command will need to
be reissued when the printer is quiescent.
