This is gimp-print version 4.0.0, the first stable release in the 4.0
line.

This software includes the Print plug-in for the Gimp (1.0, 1.1, and
1.2), and GhostScript and CUPS drivers.  The support for printers in
GhostScript and CUPS is identical to the support for these printers in
the Print plugin -- they use the identical code base.  Please read
Ghost/README and CUPS/README.txt for more information on this.


Gimp-Print 4.0.0 is a major release of the Gimp Print plugin and
associated stp GhostScript driver and CUPS driver.  Among the new
features over the 2.0 (distributed with the Gimp 1.0) and 3.0
(distributed with some versions of the Gimp 1.1) releases are:

1) Support for many more printers, including advanced Epson Stylus
   printers and many Canon BubbleJets.  This software now fully
   supports 6 color printers with variable dot sizes.

2) Greatly improved print quality.  Photographs can now be printed
   with excellent (certainly not "perfect") color fidelity and
   smoothness of tone.

3) A much-enhanced GUI in the Gimp plugin, particularly for users of
   recent Gimp 1.1 releases.  This GUI offers better placement
   controls, a live preview (for Gimp 1.1.21+/1.2 only), and other
   control improvements.

4) Included Ghostscript and CUPS drivers derived from the same source
   base as the Print plugin, enabling general printing of the same
   quality as printing from the Gimp.

5) Included support from the Foomatic project (see
   http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html), greatly easing the
   pain of configuring printers.  Foomatic is a system for using free
   software printer drivers with common spoolers on Unix.  It supports
   LPD, PDQ, CUPS, the VA Linux LPD, and LPRng.

6) Greatly improved performance in many common cases.  While
   photographs rendered in the highest quality modes still require
   considerable computation, typical text and graphics now render much
   faster.  There are some new special-purpose extremely fast
   dithering algorithms that can be used.

7) The default color and dithering settings are much more accurate
   than in previous releases.

8) Users of the Print plugin in the Gimp: PLEASE NOTE THAT THE printrc
   FILE FORMAT IN THIS RELEASE IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE WITH THE
   FORMAT IN 3.0 AND PREVIOUS RELEASES!  The main issue here is that
   running the plug-in in this release will convert your printrc file
   to the new format, which old releases cannot read.

The following printers are supported by gimp-print 4.0.0.  Note that
not all of these printers can print with highest quality.  In
particular, we do not have sufficient information on the Canon and HP
printers to support highest quality printing.  In general, the Epson
Stylus printers all support high quality printing:

ERRATA:

1) PostScript files (and PPD's) with embedded .setpagedevice commands
   to choose a media type will not function correctly.  In place of
   MediaType, stpMediaType will allow a choice of media type.  This
   will not be fixed in the release; it is not always possible to know
   what media types are valid at the time of the .setpagedevice call,
   which GhostScript requires.

2) The higher resolutions of the HP Deskjet 900/1220C and the HP
   PhotoSmart P1000/P1100 have been disabled as they do not work.
   Investigation into these modes (Photo-Ret III) is continuing.  It
   is possible that these resolutions will be re-enabled in a later
   update to 4.0.

3) There are some known color generation problems.  In particular,
   greens (particularly weakly saturated greens) tend to be quite
   weak, giving grass a somewhat tan look.  This may be improved
   somewhat by printing in 4-color rather than 6-color mode.  The
   errors in color are not radical, but it may be hard to get a close
   match for extremely critical work.

   If the image is radically too light and washed out (or radically
   too dark), please check the color settings, and try setting the
   defaults (1.0 for all options).

4) When using Epson 4x6 photo paper that is perforated to allow
   tearing off the unprintable margins it is possible to print part
   way into those margins.  This will not be fixed in the release.
   You must specify the correct image positioning in the plugin.

5) Red Hat 6.1 users cannot configure the plug-in.  The problem is
   that neither the gimp nor the gimp-devel rpm's in that release
   include gimptool, which is necessary for configuration to work.
   This will not be fixed in the release; it is not possible for us to
   distribute a version of gimptool that will work in all cases.  This
   has no effect on the usability of the GhostScript or CUPS drivers.

   The recommended fix is to recompile the Gimp from source (either
   1.0.4 or the latest 1.1/1.2 release).  That will install gimptool,
   and you will then be able to build the plug-in.  This does not
   affect the Ghostscript driver.

6) The Epson Stylus Color 480 and 580 printers are not supported.
   These printers use a somewhat different print head from all other
   Epson Stylus printers that requires additional work.  In addition,
   these printers require a special command sequence to change the ink
   cartridge (there are no front panel buttons to change the
   cartridge), and that sequence is unavailable to us.  We do not
   anticipate supporting these printers.


EARLIER RELEASES

For users of earlier versions in the gimp-print 4.0 line (3.1 and 4.0
alpha and beta releases), the following release notes covering
specific point releases are included.

Gimp-Print 4.0.0 contains the following fixes over Gimp-Print 4.0b3:

1) All HP LaserJet printers except for the 4L are capable of 600 DPI
   resolution.

2) Any residual problems with the plugin printer list containing
   duplicates should now be fixed.

3) Any residual problems with scaling not being set properly in PPI
   mode should now be fixed.

4) An extraneous dependency on the glibc version of getopt() in
   escputil has been removed.

5) 'make clean' is now a bit more complete.

6) Certain Epson Stylus printers (the Stylus Pro XL, Stylus Color 400,
   500, and 600, and Stylus Photo, Photo 700, and Photo EX) will not
   print quite as close to the bottom of the paper, due to some
   reports of overrunning pages.  This is presumably due to paper size
   or printers not being perfectly in spec.

7) Canon printers at 1440x720 DPI positioned the image too far to the
   left edge of the paper.


Gimp-Print 4.0b3 contains the following fixes over Gimp-Print 4.0b2:

1) The gimp-print configure script failed on version of the Gimp older
   than 1.1.20 or thereabouts, give or take a few versions.  That
   should now work correctly.

2) The Ghostscript and CUPS drivers did not handle printer-specific
   default options correctly.  This led to incorrect gamma and/or
   density on many printers, and on the Epson Stylus Photo 870/1270, a
   green tint.

3) Some of the defined PCL paper sizes were not included.

4) We have been unable to get the Epson Stylus Color 480 to work
   correctly in any mode, due to some quirks with this printer.  We
   have therefore removed it from the release.  It was not possible to
   change the ink cartridge on this printer in any event, due to the
   lack of front panel buttons and inability to get the necessary
   command to change the cartridge.

5) The Canon BJC-7000 had an incorrect definition.

6) The native CUPS driver did not correctly handle the printer
   resolution for non-Epson printers.

7) With CUPS 1.1.3 and earlier, the CUPS drivers do not pass through
   the media type correctly, so the driver always prints with the
   default media type.  The solution is to upgrade to CUPS 1.1.4.

8) With CUPS 1.1.3 and earlier, Under some circumstances the margins
   are not set correctly.  The solution is to upgrade to CUPS 1.1.4.


Gimp-Print 4.0b2 contains the following fixes and improvements over
Gimp-Print 4.0b1:

1) The GhostScript and Foomatic drivers did not handle paper sizes
   other than letter size.

2) The Foomatic drivers did not handle media type other than the
   model-specific default.

3) PCL printers that do not support 600x600 in color will now fall
   back correctly to 600x600 mono.

4) The print plugin crashed on startup during the second and later
   invocations if scaling was set to PPI mode.

5) In PPI mode, the print plugin did not set the initial image size
   correctly.

6) print-weave.c now compiles on all platforms.

7) The files 'cups/command.types' and 'cups/calibrate.ppm' are now
   present.

8) The arguments to escputil have changed.  Instead of -l or -o to
   specify old or new series printers, the argument -m is used to
   specify the actual printer model.  In addition, escputil will now
   attempt to autodetect the printer model for alignment purposes.

9) Print dot size at 360 DPI is now correct on the Epson Stylus Photo
   720.

10) The default saturation level in Photograph mode (image type 2) has
   been reduced.  The new default saturation of 1.0 corresponds to a
   saturation level of 0.625 previously.

11) The configure script in 4.0b1 did not function with the Gimp
   1.1.26 (which was released after 4.0b1) or with certain very
   recent snapshots of GNOME which may contain very new Gimp code.

12) The HP 1220C driver now supports large paper sizes.

13) The Epson Stylus Color 480 now prints.  However, the driver is not
   very useful, as it is not possible to change the ink cartridge
   (that can only be done under software control with undocumented
   commands).

14) A new paper size has been added that should be correct for Epson
   4x6 photo paper (which is actually slightly larger than that, about
   4.25x6.875).  Note, however, that you must still position the image
   correctly in the plugin in order to get a correct printout; the
   margins for this special paper will not be set automatically, and
   if you are not careful you may get a print too large or not placed
   correctly, overrunning the perforations.

15) Newly added printers in the plugin often had their parameters set
   incorrectly (most notably the gamma value, resulting in too-light
   prints).  That is now believed to be fixed going forward.  However,
   existing printers are not changed.  Therefore, when you first use a
   printer in the print plugin, please use the color window to check
   that the parameters are set to their correct defaults (use the Set
   Defaults button in the Gimp 1.1/1.2 GUI, or set all of the
   parameters to 1.0 in the Gimp 1.0 GUI).


Gimp-Print 4.0b1 contains the following improvements and changes over
Gimp-Print 4.0a3:

1) For Gimp plug-in users: the format of the printrc file has changed
   in a way that is incompatible with older versions of the plugin.
   This version of the software can read old printrc files, but older
   versions of the plugin cannot read the new format.

   The new format uses a keyword-based approach that is far superior
   to the old format, and will be much more amenable to future changes
   that may become necessary.

2) Support for the HP Deskjet 800 series has been changed
   incompatibly.  The "pcl-800" driver (HP Deskjet 800 series) no
   longer exists, since the 800 series printers fall into two distinct
   groups, the older 850/855/870/890 printers which supported 4-level
   dithering (HP calls this C-RET) at 300x300 DPI, and the newer
   810/812/840/842/895 printers which do not support C-RET at 300x300
   DPI (these are the same as the Deskjet 600 series).

   If you are using the gimp plugin, re-select your 800 series printer
   from the combo box and re-save the settings.

   If you are using the Ghostscript driver, choose from one of the
   pcl-8xx values detailed in Ghost/README.

   If you have an 800 series printer that is not on the list, please
   try both the old C-RET driver (choose model 890) and the non C-RET
   driver (choose model 895) and see which one works at 300x300 dpi.
   Also, please let us know; the address is in the README file.

3) The HP Deskjet 1220C has been grouped with the 900 series.

4) The HP PhotoSmart P1000 and P1100 have been added, they are like
   the HP 900 series.

5) Online documentation for the print plugin finally exists.

6) Support for CUPS, through a choice of a native CUPS driver or
   Cups-o-Matic.

7) Support for the Foomatic printer configuration system, greatly
   simplifying configuration and use with lpd, CUPS, and PDQ.

8) The preview window in the plugin now shows a low-resolution
   representation of the actual image.  The color adjustment window
   shows an thumbnail that reflects the effect that color adjustments
   have on the output.

9) The old GTK-based interface is now disabled by default when used
   with the Gimp 1.1.  It can be enabled by running configure with
   --enable-maintainer-mode.

10) The plugin now detects the spooling system at runtime, so it need
   not be compiled specifically for use with Berkeley lpd, System V
   lp, CUPS, or LPRng.

11) Substantial quality improvement for many Epson Stylus printers in
   in 1440x720 DPI modes.  The price is that printing takes much
   longer.  If you need high quality with better performance, use
   720x720 DPI Highest Quality.

   The specific printers that are affected are the Epson Stylus Color
   600, 800, 850, 900, 1520, and 3000, and the Epson Stylus Photo 700
   and EX.  The effect in all cases will be smoother output that is
   particularly visible in pale tones.

12) The Fast dither algorithm has been slightly tweaked, and a Very
   Fast dither algorithm has been added.

13) Most menus have been converted to combo boxes.

14) The printrc code has been fixed to set reasonable defaults if an
   old printrc file with now-invalid parameter settings is read.

15) It is now possible to print in seascape and upside down portrait
   mode.

16) The support for the Stylus Photo 2000P has been fixed and should
   now be correct.

17) Printer names may now be up to 127 characters.

18) Additional performance improvements over earlier versions of this
    package.

19) A number of miscellaneous bugs have been fixed.


Gimp-Print 4.0a3 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print
4.0a2:

1) The brightness, contrast, and color level controls have changed
   incompatibly in both the plugin and the Ghostscript driver.  The
   controls now adjust cyan, magenta, and yellow levels.  In addition,
   all controls are now arbitrary values centered around 1, rather
   than some being centered around 1 and some being integer values
   centered around 100.

   Furthermore, the action of the color level controls is now much
   more what would be expected.  The cyan, magenta, and yellow
   controls can be used to balance the printer grayscale.

   Plug-in users: please be sure to check the color values in the
   Adjust Color window before printing or reporting a problem.  Use
   the Set Defaults button to bring them back to reasonable defaults.

   Ghostscript users: please see the Color Balancing Values section of
   Ghost/README for details.

2) The MediaSource argument in the Ghostscript driver has been renamed
   InputSlot, to conform to the PPD standard.  Therefore, any
   uses of Ghostscript that use this argument must change.

3) There is a new Fast dither algorithm.  This produces greatly
   improved speed at some cost in image quality.  It gives poor
   results on 6-color printers when used in 6-color mode.  In black
   and white mode, the results are generally quite acceptable.

4) Performance has been improved to some degree in all modes.  This
   will probably be most noticeable when printing text, and when
   printing at a higher resolution than the source image is sampled at.

5) Density is now computed correctly in 1440x720 mode on Canon
   printers.

6) Positioning should now be correct on the Epson Stylus Color 850 and
   similar printers.

7) The inlining problems with egcs 1.1.2 are now fixed properly, so
   inlining is re-enabled.

8) The problem with blank splotches is now fixed.  It was closely
   related to the other inlining problems (which weren't really
   inlining problems at all).

9) Ink densities and other color parameters have been tuned for
   additional paper types.  In particular, plain paper and generic ink
   jet paper should now work reasonably well.

10) Monochrome mode prints with correct density on variable dot size
   printers (it was printing too light or entirely incorrectly).

11) The Gimp-based GUI (usable only with Gimp 1.1.22+) has been
   extensively reorganized.

12) Monochrome (fast black-only) mode works correctly on variable dot
   size printers.

13) HP printers with multiple input sources now print correctly by
   default (using the standard paper source rather than the manual
   feed).

14) Bug fixes to the Canon driver for certain printers.

15) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus Photo 2000P, Stylus Color
   880, and Stylus Color 980.  The 880 and 980 should work reasonably
   well.  The 2000P has not been tuned.

16) Performance and print quality on the Epson Stylus Color 900 is
   improved.

17) There have been some miscellaneous improvements (or at least
   changes) in color generation.

18) Images will now print to their exact specified size.  In previous
   versions, if percentage scaling was used, the scale was effectively
   rounded down to the next percentage point.

19) The height/width entries are more accurate, and do not
   automatically set the scaling mode to PPI.

20) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus Color 880 and 980
   printers.

21) Miscellaneous bug fixes for certain Epson Stylus printers.


Gimp-Print 4.0a2 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print
4.0a1:

1) A serious bug in the handling of landscape mode (in the plugin
   only) has been fixed.

2) A new 360 dpi softweave mode has been added to the Epson driver for
   the variable drop size printers, which should yield improved
   quality.  It is reasonably well tuned on the 870.

3) Improved tonal smoothness in highly saturated red, green, and blue.

4) The Ghostscript driver produces more useful error messages if
   incorrect parameters are supplied.

5) The top margin of the Epson Stylus Color 850 should be correct
   now.  The printer is not capable of printing to the top of the
   page.

6) Ink levels have been fine tuned (not necessarily correctly) for
   newer Epson printers.

7) Work around some inlining problems with egcs 1.1.2.


Gimp-Print 4.0a1 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.9:

1) The Ghostscript driver has been extensively revised.  IN
   PARTICULAR, THE OPTIONS HAVE CHANGED TO A DEGREE MAKING IT
   IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY USES OF THE OLD DRIVER FROM WORKING WITH THE NEW
   ONE.  Please read Ghost/README for a full explanation of the new
   options.

2) The Ghostscript driver now supports all printers supported by the
   Gimp plug-in, including PCL and Canon printers in addition to Epson
   Stylus inkjets.

3) Photo mode has had major improvements in its color generation in
   corner cases.  It is slower than it used to be, unfortunately.

4) The inks have been retuned for 6-color Epson printers; they should
   now better match those of 4-color printers.

5) It is now possible to print to the very edge of the top, left, and
   right on Epson Stylus 870 and 1270 printers.

6) An experimental CUPS driver is now in place in the Cups
   subdirectory.  It is not based on the current source base.  It will
   be redone before 4.0 release.

7) Printing near the top and bottom of the paper is substantially
   improved on Epson Stylus printers.

8) Printing on PCL printers is fixed.

9) Epson Stylus printers have more flexible tuning than previously,
   allowing specification of smaller dot sizes in some cases, which
   will yield better output quality.

10) Ghostscript driver bug whereby only half the page was printed in
   certain resolutions is now fixed.

11) Adaptive hybrid dithering is now the default.


Gimp-Print 3.1.9 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.8:

1) A bug in the GhostScript driver would cause the driver to go into
   an infinite loop on some systems with some printers, depending upon
   details of the compiler and so forth.  All users of the GhostScript
   driver should immediately update.

2) Substantial quality improvements across many printers:

   * Output across printers and resolution modes is much more closely
     matched (except probably 360 DPI).  The saturation may be
     somewhat less than before, however.

   * 720 DPI is greatly improved on Epson Stylus Color 860/1160 and
     Stylus Photo 870/1270.  The 750/1200 may not show this
     improvement.

   * Artifacts in the adaptive hybrid and adaptive random dithering
     modes have been eliminated.


Gimp-Print 3.1.8 contains the following improvements over 3.1.7:

1) The entries for printer model and paper size have been greatly
   improved.  There are many additional paper sizes offered.

2) Print quality using adaptive, hybrid, and ordered modes is improved
   at 1440x720 DPI.

3) The UI now offers a choice of metric or English units for
   measurements.

4) The print preview is much larger, affording easier viewing of the
   placement of the image.  An arrow is used to indicate the top of
   the paper, and the size of the arrow gives an indication of the
   actual paper size.

5) It is now possible to specify the output width or height directly.

6) Dragging the preview image with a button other than the left moves
   the image in units of points rather than screen pixels, affording
   finer placement control.

7) A new emulated 1440x2880 mode has been added for highest quality
   printing on Epson Stylus printers.  It is of most use on the Stylus
   Photo 750, 1200, 870, and 1270.

8) Experimental improvements for the Canon BJC-8200.

9) The plug-in should operate correctly with the plp spooling system.

10) Support for the Epson Stylus Photo 720 and Stylus Color 480.  Also
   correct the Stylus Color 860 and 1160 entries.

11) Support for the HP 540C printer.

12) Correct treatment of saturation adjustment, and allow saturation
   of 0.  This allows printing a color image in black and white using
   color inks for maximum smoothness.

13) Allow choice of four and six color printing on six color
   printers.  This is useful for economy (normal printing uses much
   more light cyan and magenta than dark), and may improve saturation
   for graphics.

14) Bug fixes for Ghostscript driver.  Also, Ghostscript driver now
   offers choice of ink type.

15) Some improvement in Epson Stylus Photo, Photo 700, and Photo EX
   output quality.


Gimp-Print 3.1.7 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.6:

1) Emergency GhostScript bug fix.

2) escputil program now retrieves ink level from the printer.


Gimp-Print 3.1.6 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.5:

1) Print speed has been greatly improved for sparse pages.  This will
   not help too much for images, but it will help greatly for text and
   other typical PostScript printing.

2) 3.1.5 turned out not to improve print quality over 3.1.4; in fact,
   there was some regression.  There has been some improvement over
   3.1.5, particularly for higher end printers.  1440x720 enhanced
   mode (which is computed as 1440x1440) using adaptive hybrid or
   adaptive random dithering appears to work best.

3) Microweave and 360 dpi positioning is now correct.

4) The Lexmark 4076 is now supported (as a PCL printer).

5) The preview window now notes the size of the image in addition to
   the position.

6) The code now uses much less memory at high quality settings.

7) Perturbed ordered dithering has been removed.

8) An experimental program to perform nozzle check, head cleaning, and
   head alignment is now included.  This is potentially dangerous, so
   read the accompanying help information carefully before performing
   head alignment!

9) The Ghostscript driver now correctly handles -r1440x720.

10) The PDQ support has been updated, and a CUPS .ppd file added
   (these are not tested).


Gimp-Print 3.1.5 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.4:

1) Greatly improved print quality.  In particular, ordered dithering
   and adaptive dithering methods are now much better than ever
   before.  We recommend ordered dithering for four-color printers and
   either adaptive hybrid or adaptive random dithering for six-color
   printers.

2) If a print job is canceled from within the Gimp, the partial file
   will not be sent to the printer.

3) Support for additional Canon and Hewlett-Packard printers.

4) Epson Stylus printers can now print much closer to the edge of the
   page.  They can print to the extreme top edge and much closer to
   the bottom than before, although there is some loss in quality
   close to the edge.

5) Greatly improved black quality.

6) The preview window now shows the borders of the printable area in
   addition to the borders of the page.  In addition, the offsets are
   now from the true edge of the page rather than from the edge of the
   printable area.

7) 720 dpi highest quality and 1440x720 dpi highest quality are now
   supported on the new generation Epson printers.

8) Epson printers will now print faster on sparse pages and in pure
   black and white.  This is of particular interest for the
   Ghostscript driver.


Gimp-Print 3.1.4 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.3:

1) Support for the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 960.

2) Print quality improvements.

3) Some print speed optimizations.

4) Major fix for hybrid Floyd-Steinberg dithering


Gimp-Print 3.1.3 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.2:

1) Completely revamped dithering algorithms.  These algorithms should
   be faster and easier to maintain in addition to better,
   particularly on more advanced printers.  There are additional
   choices for dithering algorithms: an ordered dither, and two kinds
   of Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion.  There are also adaptive error
   diffusion algorithms, in which ordered dithering is used in certain
   circumstances.

2) The user interface has been heavily revamped.  There are currently
   two options, one based on the Gimp native toolkit and one based on
   GTK.  Depending upon user feedback, one will be withdrawn at some
   point.

4) Support for additional Hewlett-Packard printers and media.

3) Bug fixes for Epson printers, the GhostScript driver, and many
   other things.


Gimp-Print 3.1.2 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.1:

1) Better dither quality.

2) Dither is optimized for several different types of images
   (photographs, continuous-tone images such as charts, line art, and
   very fast pure black/white rendering).

3) Tweaking of the GhostScript driver.

4) Epson Stylus Color 440 prints in softweave.  In general, most Epson
   printers are more reliable.

5) Preliminary support for more Hewlett-Packard printers.



Gimp-Print 3.1.1 contains the following improvements over Gimp-Print 3.1.0:

1) Faster dithering speed.

2) Improved support for many Epson Stylus printers.

3) Some UI improvements.

4) Numerous bug fixes.


Gimp-Print 3.1.0 contains the following user-visible improvements over
Gimp-Print 3.0.5, the version distributed with the Gimp 1.1.17:

1) Preliminary support for Canon BubbleJet printers (specifically the
   BJC6000).

2) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus Color 440/640/740/900 and
   Stylus Photo 750/1200 printers.  These printers should in theory
   work in all modes, although that has not been comprehensively
   tested.  1440 dpi mode on the 900 in particular may not work.
   There is also pre-preliminary support for the Stylus Photo 870 and
   1270 based on the published specifications.  This driver is
   completely untuned for these printers at present.

3) Ability to position the image on the page to the point (1/72", or
   about .35 mm), along with a more accurate depiction of the
   positioning on the page.

4) One-click ability to scale to the image resolution (Gimp 1.1 only).

5) Much better handling of the saved state (printrc file), including
   saving of parameters related to file output.

6) Utilities (in various states of completion) to reconstitute an
   image from a print file.

7) Bug fixes for density in indexed and gray modes, and for excess
   pseudo-black printing in general.

There are additional improvements over Print 2.0.2 (the version
distributed with Gimp 1.1.11 and earlier) too numerous to list here.
