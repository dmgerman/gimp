The original version, up to release 2.0, of the Gimp Print plug-in was
written by Mike Sweet <mike@easysw.com>.

Version 3.0, which is based on version 2, was written by Robert
Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu> in late 1999, and frozen in early 2000.

Version 4.0 was developed by a team led by Robert Krawitz.  We hosted
the development on SourceForge, a service provided to the free source
community by VA Linux Systems.  The complete hosting service provided
by SourceForge permitted the development team to concentrate on
improving the software rather than having to worry about maintaining a
development system.

follows.  The principal areas that each contributed to are listed in
addition.
