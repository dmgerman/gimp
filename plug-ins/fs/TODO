Add all the autoconfig/automake stuff, so that the standard build
procedures and such can be used.

Figure out why the fs executable is as large as it is, and fix it,
unless the automake fix cures this as well.

Handle non-square pixels properly.  If px!=ix or py!=iy, there should
be an option to correct the display.  I'm not sure whether this
correction should be on or off by default.  Turning it on loses
information; leaving it off distorts the image display.  Sigh,
decisions, decisions...

Save header lines on input so that they can be restored on output.
The "Image:" line will have to be special cased, depending on what
gets done about non-square pixels.  All other lines can just be cached
on input and restored on output.

Write some help information.
