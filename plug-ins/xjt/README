xjt is a file plug-in to load and save GIMP RGB and GRAY Images with
all its layers, channels and guides.

Started implementation TATTOO, PARASITE RESOLUTION 1999.02.01

(see README_xjt_fileformat.txt for more Information about XJT)


   The XJT Load/Save Plugin requires:

     - GIMP 1.0.0 (or better)
     - libjpeg
     - Unix tar
     - Unix gzip   (optional)
     - Unix bzip2  (optional)
     - gap_patches (optional)  **)
     
        **) NO PATCHES are required if you have the latest development version of GIMP 1.1



Installation:
-------------
   
   If You are using GIMP 1.0.2 (or older versions):
       
       # (optional) install gap_patches
       # they are available at the registry at:

       # http://gimp.foebud.org/registry/detailview.phtml?plugin=gap_patches            
       # or at:
       # http://gimp.foebud.org/registry/detailview.phtml?plugin=gap
      
       
       cp Makefile.1.0 Makefile
  
   If you are using GIMP 1.1.1
   
       # GIMP 1.1.1 is an unstable prerelease.
       
       cp Makefile.1.1 Makefile
 
   # edit the Makefile to fit your setup
   # then type 
   make            # to compile and
   make install    # to install the plugin
   
   


Change Log:
-----------
 1.02  1999.02.??  added load/save for resolution, tattoos, and parasites 
                   (works only with gimp 1.1.1)
 1.01  1998.11.24  added load/save for guides (works only with gimp 1.1)
                   added Makefiles to compile xjt under gimp 1.0.2 and 1.1

Restrictions of the XJT release 1.01:
-----------------------------------------
   The 1.01 implementation of xjt is now able to save and load
   the full Image Information (including guides) on RGB and GRAY Images.
   when xjt is used with the latest development version of GIMP 1.1.
   
   If xjt is used with GIMP 1.0.2 (or earlier versions)
   there are some restrictions:

   GUIDES  are ignored at save and load.
           (GIMP 1.0.2 has no Interface to access GUIDES from a plugin)
          
   LINKED to load/save the linked state of a Layer 
          you must install the GAP_PATCHES to the gimp core.
          (GIMP 1.0.2 has no Interface to access the Layers LINKED state from a plugin)

   FLOATING_SELECTION
          are supported by the XJT Fileformat, but you need to apply the GAP_PATCHES
	  to the gimp core.
	  Without the patches:
	  - XJT can not find out the drawable where the floating selection
	    is attached to. (the PROP_FLOATING_ATTACHED property information
	    is not saved to the PRP file in that case)
	  - XJT can not attach the floating selection to a layer or channel
	    at load. (even if you add the PROP_FLOATING_ATTACHED to the PRP file
	    with an editor)
	    
   
  The GAP_PATCHES provide some of the missing PDB-interfaces 
  (except those for guides, tattoos, parasites and resolution)
  for GIMP-core versions from 1.0.0 upto 1.0.2.
