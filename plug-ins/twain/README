This plug-in interfaces to the TWAIN support library in order
to capture images from TWAIN devices directly into GIMP images.
The plug-in is capable of acquiring the following type of
images:
 - B/W (1 bit images translated to grayscale B/W)
 - Grayscale up to 16 bits per pixel
 - RGB up to 16 bits per sample (24, 30, 36, etc.)
 - Paletted images (both Gray and RGB)

Prerequisites:
 This plug-in will not compile on anything other than a Win32
 platform.  Although the TWAIN documentation implies that there
 is TWAIN support available on Macintosh, I neither have a 
 Macintosh nor the interest in porting this.  If anyone else
 has an interest, consult www.twain.org for more information on
 interfacing to TWAIN.

Known problems:

 - Multiple image transfers will hang the plug-in.  The current
   configuration compiles with a maximum of single image transfers.

Debugging:
 There are two different versions of the program included, a standard
 version and a version built for debugging.  The debugging version is
 a special version capable of capturing the TWAIN datasource data to
 a file for later processing.  This feature can be used to create a data
 dump that can be sent to me if for some reason the plug-in fails for
 your TWAIN datasource.  The function of the plug-in is controlled by
 the name of the executable file.  The plug-in should be placed in your
 plug-ins directory and named as follows:

twain.exe - This is the standard (non-debugging) version.  This file will
  not behave differently if renamed.  This version is intended to be used
  unless your TWAIN datasource has some problem.

gtwain.exe - This is the debugging version of the program shipped along.
  If this program is used as named, it will behave the same as "twain.exe"
  except that the file C:\twain.log will be written.  This file is a text
  file with very little information available for debugging.

dtwain.exe - Renaming "gtwain.exe" to "dtwain.exe" in your plug-ins directory
  will change the behavior of the plug-in.  The menu option will be registered
  as "TWAIN Acquire (Dump)..." and will cause the TWAIN acquire operation to
  be dumped to the file "C:\twaincap.bin".  This file contains all of the data
  necessary to recreate the capture on another system (such as my machine).  The
  image will not be displayed, as it might cause the plug-in to crash making
  the data useless.  Instead, a message will be displayed that the image
  information was dumped to a file.

rtwain.exe - Renaming "gtwain.exe" to "rtwain.exe" in your plug-ins directory
  will change the behavior of the plug-in.  The menu option will be registered
  as "TWAIN Acquire (Read)..." and will cause the TWAIN acquire operation to
  read a previously dumped (using dtwain.exe) TWAIN acquire from 
  "C:\twaincap.bin".

If you find that you are unable to capture data from you datasource (the plug-in
crashes or the image is wrong), please capture data using the following steps:

1) Copy gtwain.exe to your plug-ins directory as "dtwain.exe".
2) Run The GIMP.
3) Choose Xtns->TWAIN Acquire (Dump)...
4) Choose the datasource settings that are causing problems.
5) Choose a *SMALL* sample image.
6) Zip up "C:\twaincap.bin" and "C:\twain.log" and send them to me.
