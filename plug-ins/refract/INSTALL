If this file came as part of a GIMP distribution, no special
installation instructions are required.  Refract will get built and
installed when all the other plug-ins do.

However, if you wish to install this plug-in seperately, perhaps
because it's a newer version than the one in your distribution...

First, try typing 

make install

If that worked, stop reading and go play with GIMP.  If it didn't,
read on...

At this point in time, refract needs the files megawidget.h and
megawidget.o to compile.  Since I've found megawidgets don't fully
suffice my needs, this will probably change in the near future.  But
for now, stick those files (or links to them) somewhere where your
compiler can find them when compiling refract...  They should be
included somewhere in the plug-ins directory of your GIMP source
distribution.

You may also wish to dink with the compiler options in the Makefile.
At the moment, as refract is still Not Quite There Yet, it comes
shipped with all sorts of debugging flags turned on and optimizations
turned OFF.  If you don't care why refract crashes if and when it
does, go ahead and comment out the debug flags and uncomment the
optimizations.  Hopefully it will pick up some speed that way.

There are also a few options available for dinking in refract.h, but
none too interesting at the moment.
