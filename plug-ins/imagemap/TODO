BUGS

* Polygon not limited to 100 points (Is this really neccessary?)
* Rulers move when scrolling in preview window (see interface.c in Gimp).
* 'Move' only moves current object.

Miscellaneous

* Zooming performance is poor
* Compare image-name in HTML file with loaded image and issue warning
  if different.
* Restrict to screen size for large images.
* Don't redraw complete polygon while moving a sash.
* Compliancy with GIMP 1.1.x:
  - Use GIMP's 1.1.x new help system
  - Tear-off menu's
  - Arrow button with similar action as pop-up in upper left of preview window
  - Paner widget in lower right of preview window for fast navigation.
