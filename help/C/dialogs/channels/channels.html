>    The <SPAN

>Channels</SPAN

    <SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"
>RGB</SPAN
> channels, showing the current red, green, or
    blue color values of each pixel in your image. The
    <SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"
>RGB</SPAN
> channel thumbnails are grayscale
    representations of each color channel with white representing 100%
    color and black representing no color.
  </P
><P
>    The <SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"
>RGB</SPAN
> channels each have an
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIICON"
>eye</SPAN
> icon, so you can look at your image in a
    single color channel. Click off the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIICON"
>eye</SPAN
> icon in
    the Blue and Green channels, so that only the Red channel is
    visible.  Bright red in the red channel is the equivalent of a
    maximum red value for that pixel; black means that the pixel has
    no red at all in it. You will see bright red for areas that are
    white or bright red. If all three channels have maximum values for
    an area, that area is white in the actual image.
  </P
><P
>    The <SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"
>RGB</SPAN
> channels are always active when a layer
    is active.  They display the color values of all visible layers,
    not just the active one. Unlike layers, the <SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"
>RGB</SPAN
>
    channels can all be active at the same time. You can also choose
    to work in one or two specific color channels by clicking on the
    appropriate channels to activate the ones you want and deactivate
    the ones you don't want.
  </P

    button. This will bring up the <A
HREF="../../dialogs/channels/new_channel.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>New
    Channel</SPAN
></A
> dialog where you can set name, color,
    and fill amount of the new channel. If you want to alter the
    values later on, you just double click on the channel which will
    bring up the <A
HREF="../../dialogs/channels/edit_channel_attributes.html"
>    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Edit Channel Attributes</SPAN
> </A
> dialog.
    Normally you don't work with extra channels, but they can be very
    handy for creating and storing selections.
  </P

>    If you <SPAN
CLASS="MOUSEBUTTON"
>right</SPAN
> click on the layer name
    you will be able to access the layer menu. In the
    <SPAN

>layer</SPAN

    layer commands, see <A

    advanced colored images. The channel stack tools

    and

      store several selections. In fact, you can create selections
      from scratch by creating a new channel, altering it, and then
      applying <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Channel To Selection</SPAN
