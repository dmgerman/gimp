      This mode enables you to convert your RGB or Grayscale Image to an Indexed
      image. An Indexed image is a image which only can have the colors specified
      in it's color palette present in the image file. The maximum number of colors
      in a Index image is 256. If you want to make e.g transparent GIF images then
      you can only have a maximum of 255 colors since the last color (i.e color
      number 256) will be used to determine if the pixel is opaque or transparent.

	<DD>
	  This is most of the time the best options to create a indexed image with.
	  Gimp will evaluate your colors and create a color palette suitable for the
	  image. You can specify the amount of colors that you want to have in your
	  index image but remember that you can't have more than 255 colors if are
	  about to create a index image with transparency.

	  <EM>Use custom palette:</EM>
	<DD>
	  If you want to use a predefined palette you have to use this option. You
	  have to choose your palette from the drop down menu, by default it's Web
	  palette. The Web palette is the palette used by e.g Netscape. This will help
	  you create web safe index images images (There is some debate if you should
	  index against the Web palette or not. Please see The Gimp User's Manual page
	  XXXX for further information).

	      Remove unused colo(u)rs from final palette: If palette contains colors that
	      aren't used in the Index image you can remove those colors and make the image
	      file size smaller. This is a good option so keep it enabled.
	  </DL>
	<DT>
	  <EM>Use black/white (1-bit) palette:</EM>

	  This option will create a "grayscale" image only built up of either black
	  or white pixels.

	Dithering
      </H4>
      <P>
      An Index image can only be built up of a maximum of 256 colors. Most of the
      time this is quite limited and you will not be able to have all the colors
      in your image represented in this limited color space. The image will look
      like it is built up of "bands" or "color areas". To make Index images look
      better you can dither them. This means that you will mix two or several colors
      to mimic the missing color. The disadvantage is that the image can look like
      it's built up of "dots".

	  Will disable dithering totally
	<DT>
	  <EM>Positioned colo(u)r dithering:</EM>
	<DD>
	  This is a option to use when you are dealing with animations (e.g gif
	  animations). The problem with dithering with e.g Floyd Steinberg dithering
	  in animations is that the dithering will not be constant. If you instead
	  use positioned dithering the dithering in constant areas will remain constant
	  across your frames. It is not as good as Floyd Steinberg dithering but is
	  better than no dithering at all.
	<DT>
	  <EM>Floyd Steinberg dithering colo(u)r dithering (reduced colo(u)r
	  bleeding)</EM>
	<DD>
	  When you use normal Floyd Steinberg dithering you will experience that the
	  colors will bleed to much . This is very visible when you index gradients,
	  the effect is that the gradient will look unnatural. If you encounter this
	  effect it's advisable to use this option (i.e Floyd Steinberg dithering reduced
	  colour bleeding).
	<DT>
	  <EM>Floyd Steinberg dithering (normal):</EM>
	<DD>
	  This is the best option to use when you are indexing images. It's only in
	  special cases that you will use the other dithering methods available.
	<DT>
	<DD>
	<DT>
	  <EM>Enable dithering of transparency:</EM>
	<DD>
	  Index images only have one transparency mode either it is off (the pixel
	  is totally solid) or on (the pixel is totally transparent). This makes it
	  very difficult to index images with smooth transitions from opaque to
	  transparent. When you enable dithering of transparency Gimp will try to mimic
	  the smooth transition by dithering pixels on and off. Note: A good alternative
	  to transparency dithering is the
	  <CODE><A HREF="../filters/semiflatten.html">right-click|Filters|Colors|Semi-Flatten</A></CODE>
	  function.
