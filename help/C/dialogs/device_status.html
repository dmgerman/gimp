      <P>
      The Device dialog will show you the status of your input devices. This is
      (only) useful if you have a drawing tablet. If you do have then you will
      be able to see and adjust what tool, color, brush, pattern and gradient you
      have assigned to your different pens (i.e input devices).
      <P>
      To alter the context each device has you simply drag and drop brushes, tools
      etc. with the middle mouse button from the respective dialog (e.g you drag
      and drop tools from the tool box).
      <P>
      It can be very wise to set up a standard context for all your tools and save
      it (and disable saving of device status on exit in the preference dialog).
      By doing so you will always have the same settings of the tools each time
      you start Gimp.
