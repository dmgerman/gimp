    Open dialog is where you can load images into the Gimp for viewing 
or editing. The left hand window shows the directories and the right 
hand side shows the files in the selected directory. To open a file, 
select it in the files listing, then choose what file type it is - if 
the file has an extension which defines it's filetype (such as .xcf) 
you can select "Automatic" and Gimp will open the file in that format. 
Alternatively, you can force Gimp to open the file as a specific format 
by choosing one of the other options in the drop down list.
    <P>
    Some images have a preview associated with then so you can see what 
the image is before opening it. This is particularly useful for larger 
images, where opening the full image will take a while. If an image 
doesn't have a preview, you can click "Generate Preview" to create on. 
This preview image is stored in the a sub-directory of the current one, 
called .xvpics. This preview image will be used in future when using 
the open dialog. Clicking OK opens the image with the selected 
settings, Cancel aborts.

    A useful feature of the Load Image dialog is autocompletion of 
filenames. Type the first few letters of the filename and pressing the 
Tab key will complete as much of the filename as is uniquely defined by 
what has already been typed. The side of the dialog will display all 
files that match the letters in the selection box. You can then type 
more letters and press Tab again to update the window. You 
can load multiple images by pressing Shift key and clicking on each 
file you want to open.
