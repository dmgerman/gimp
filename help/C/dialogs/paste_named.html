      Gimp has a cut and copy buffer, see Cut Named and
      <A HREF="copy_named.html">Copy Named</A>. Objects cut or copied with those
      functions are available for pasting in Paste Named. 
      <P>
      In the dialog there is a list of all available buffers. You select the buffer
      to past by clicking on it. When the buffer is selected you have three options
      to paste it <A HREF="../image/edit/paste.html">Paste</A>,
      <A HREF="../image/edit/paste_into.html">Paste Into</A> and
      <A HREF="../image/edit/paste_as_new.html">Paste As New</A>. 
      <P>
      You can also manage buffers in the dialog. If you want to delete a buffer
      you select it and click on the Delete button. To exit the buffer with out
      pasting you click on Cancel. This will cancel the paste operation but it
      will not cancel the delete operation.
