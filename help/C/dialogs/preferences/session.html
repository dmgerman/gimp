      Session management is a way to restore your Gimp session that was running
      before you logged out. I.e leave Gimp running logout, and then login. Gimp
      will now along with the Window Manager try to restore the Gimp session you
      that was running before you logged out. You can disable/enable this feature
      with the "Always Try to Restore Session" check button. Remember your desktop
      environment must support session management otherwise this will not work.
      NOTE: If you start Gimp from e.g a script to set special environment variables
      before Gimp is started, then it's not wise too use this option.
      <P>
      Gimp can save it's window positions i.e where e.g the gradient select dialog
      is displayed on your display. If you use the Save Window Position at Exit
      option then Gimp will save the position of e.g the brush dialog (if it is
      opened). It can be useful to arrange your Gimp desktop with this option enabled
      and then restart Gimp and disable the option. You will there by have a consistent
      desktop each time you start Gimp.
      <P>
      If you have a tablet and use it with Gimp you will have several devices that
      you can preconfigure in the
      <A HREF="../input_devices.html">toolbox|File|Dialogs|Device Status</A>. However
      if you use Save Device Status on Exit option then the preconfiguration will
      be over written and the last state before exit will be the new configuration.
