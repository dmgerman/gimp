	  <EM>Levels of Undo:</EM>
	<DD>
	  By default Gimp has five levels of undo. The amount of undo levels is only
	  limited by disk space. A high amount of undo levels requires a large amount
	  of disk space so use it with care. The default value is reasonably good for
	  most use.

	  <EM>Resent Document List Size:</EM>
	<DD>
	  Will set the amount of previously opened or saved documents that you can
	  direct access in the Toolbox|File menu.

	  <EM>Nav window per display:</EM>
	<DD>

	<DD>
	  Lets you enable (disable) window resize on zoom. Normally when you zoom the
	  window size will not be affected. If you enable this function the size of
	  the window will be fitted to the size of the image when you zoom in our out.

	  <EM>Perfect-but-slow Pointer Tracking:</EM>
	<DD>
	  When you are drawing in Gimp, Gimp will not catch your pointer every moment.
	  Instead Gimp catch it a certain time interval. This means if you draw a circle
	  very fast Gimp will not draw a circle but lines between each pointer grab.
	  However if you turn on Perfect...Tracking Gimp will record every single movement
	  and make a perfect circe even if you draw it very fast. You will however
	  not be able to draw in real time instead that drawing will "played" with
	  a time delay since you "recorded" every movement. (Well this is not exactly
	  what's happens but it makes it easier to explain it this way).
	<DT>
	  <EM>Disable Cursor Updating:</EM>
	<DD>
	  Normally when you paint with e.g the airbrush you will have a little pencil
	  as cursor. If you disable cursor updating the cursor will always be a little
	  pencil even if you shift tool. I.e the cursor will always be the same shape
	  as the last tool you used before you disabled updating.

	  <EM>Use Global Paint Options:</EM>
	<DD>
	  Normally when you paint in Gimp you set the opacity and paint mode in the
	  brush dialog. If you disable Use Global Paint Options you will have the
	  opportunity to set both Opacity and paintmode separately for each tool (the
	  tool option dialog will change and you will have new controls for opacity
	  and paint mode).
	<DT>
	  <EM>Display brush and pattern indicators on Toolbar:</EM>
	<DD>
	  In the toolbox you have a area displaying the currently active brush, pattern
	  and gradient. If you don't want the area to be present in the toolbox you
	  can disable it here.
