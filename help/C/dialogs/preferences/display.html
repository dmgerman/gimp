	Transparency
      </H4>
      <P>
      Type: By default Gimp has a checker bord pattern built up of mid tone gray
      checks. You can however change that in the drop down menu. NOTE: That white,
      black and gray only checks disables checks and the transparency will be shown
      as a solid black, white or gray color.
      <P>
      Check Size: The size of the checkers in the pattern that indicates transparency.
      NOTE: If you have set the checker type to white, gray or black only then
      then the size will have no effect what so ever.
      <H4>
	Scaling
      </H4>
      <P>
      When you scale a image (make it bigger) you have to fill in missing pixels
      what color and value that those pixels should have is calculated in a
      interpolation algorithm . Gimp uses a Linear interpolation algorithm by default.
      Linear is a gives you a mid quality interpolation. Linear interpolation has
      less quality trade off for speed that Nearest Neighbour interpolation algorithm
      does. Nearest Neighbour is the fastest way to interpolate but it has the
      lowest quality of the interpolation algorithms. The Cubic interpolation algorithm
      produces the highest quality of the three interpolation types supported by
      Gimp. However it is considerable slower that the linear interpolation algorithm.
