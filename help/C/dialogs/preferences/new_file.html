	Image Size and Unit
      </H4>
      <P>
      The top fields will allow you to set the size in pixels and the bottom field
      will allow you to set the size in a arbitrary length unit. The difference
      between the two of them is that if you specify the the size in e.g inches
      then the size in pixels is dependent of the image resolution. I.e if you
      decrease the default resolution you will decrease the size in pixels but
      not the real size measured in e.g inches.
      <H4>
	Image Resolution and Resolution Unit
      </H4>
      <P>
      Let you set the default image resolution and resolution unit. The default
      image resolution is always measured in dpi (ppi) while the default resolution
      type is arbitrary. However Gimp lets you set the default resolution in your
      arbitrary resolution unit in the two bottom fields.
      <H4>
	Image Type
      </H4>
      <P>
      Lets you set what type of image you want to create by default either RGB
      or Grayscale.

	Summary
      </H4>
      <P>
      Does the size &amp; unit contra resolution image/unit sound a bit complicated
      and hard to understand? Let us give you an example. You are familiar with
      the metric system but as most designers you are more familiar with a resolution
      based on pixels per inch (ppi or dpi). Then you have to set image unit to
      millimeters (or centimeters) while you will set the resolution unit to
      pixels/inch. This will give you the comfort of working with two familiar
      units in this case size measured in the metric system and resolution measured
      in ppi. As default values that you have to set i.e size in this case millimeters
      and the resolution in ppi is up to you and what type of work you are involved
      in.
