><P
>      GIMP is optimized to speed i.e speed is more important than memory
      usage. Enabling Conservative Memory Usage will "optimize" GIMP to
      use less memory. The tradeoff is of course speed but if your system
      is low on memory then it can be an option to use Conservative Memory
      Usage.

><P
>      By default <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

> has five levels of undo.
      The amount of undo levels is only limited by disk space. A high
      amount of undo levels requires a large amount of disk space so use
      it with care. The default value is reasonably good for most use.

>      This is the most important parameter that GIMP has, if you set it
      to low GIMP will be very slow. There isn't a upper level of how much
      memory that you can give GIMP i.e give GIMP as much as you can. But
      don't give GIMP more that your physical memory (i.e pure memory
      without swap). In reality you have to measure how much memory you
      usually use and give GIMP a little less than the rest of it.

>Interpolation Type</A
></H2
><P
>      When you scale a image (make it bigger) you have to fill in missing
      pixels what color and value that those pixels should have is calculated
      in a interpolation algorithm . Gimp uses a Linear interpolation
      algorithm by default. Linear is a gives you a mid quality interpolation.
      Linear interpolation has less quality trade off for speed that Nearest
      Neighbour interpolation algorithm does. Nearest Neighbour is the fastest
      way to interpolate but it has the lowest quality of the interpolation
      algorithms. The Cubic interpolation algorithm produces the highest
      quality of the three interpolation types supported by GIMP. However it
      is considerably slower that the linear interpolation algorithm.

>      By default when you save a image a thumbnail file will be created
      storing a little image of your image. When you mark a image in the
      file open dialog you will see this thumbnail. If you set this option
      to Never you have to press on the thumbnail button in the
      <A
HREF="../../dialogs/file_open.html"

      to see a thumbnail of your image.

      a networked disk (nfs, smb etc.) then saves some times are slow and
      saving always isn't that necessary. Instead you will only save when
      the file is really changed.
