      If you create a image new image with the size of two times two inches, and
      don't have right-click|View|Dot for dot enabled. Then you should be able
      to take a folding rule, and the measure the image directly on the screen
      reading a size of two by two inches.
      <P>
      If you can't i.e the size you read is wrong then you have to adjust it in
      this dialog. Gimp is using a manual settings by default (72dpix72dpi). If
      you run Gimp on e.g a Unix workstation then you can probably use the From
      X server option and get a correct value. If you run on PC hardware you will
      most likely not be able to use the value given by the Xserver. You have to
      measure and set hose values by hand which can be a bit bulky. There is two
      fields one with the default measure unit DPI, and one with custom measure
      unit which can be useful for us how are used to the metric system.
