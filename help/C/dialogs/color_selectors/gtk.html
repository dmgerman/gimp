The GTK Color Selector
</H1>

<P>
The GTK color selector is similar to <A href="built_in.html">Gimp's standard
color</A> selector. The main difference is that you can't select in which color
space you want to work. The left color bar is always working
in value mode and you can alter the hue and saturation by dragging your
mouse in the circle.
</P>

<P>
Another difference is that the RGB values are represented in percent instead
of values from 0 to 255. 100% (1.0) is 255 and 0% (0.0) is 0.   The fact
is that you should see it as the amount of e.g. red that you want to mix into
your color.
