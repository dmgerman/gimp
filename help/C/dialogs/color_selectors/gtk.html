      <P>
      The GTK color selector is similar to <A HREF="built_in.html">Gimp's standard
      color</A> selector. The main difference is that you can't select which color
      space that you want to work with in. The left Color bar is always working
      in value mode and you will alter the hue and saturation by dragging your
      mouse in the circle.
      <P>
      An other difference is that the RGB values are represented in percent instead
      of values from 0 to 255. 100% (1.0) is 255 and 0% (0.0) is 0, depending how
      you work with colors this maybe a advantage or just cumbersome. The fact
      is that you should see it as the amount of e.g Red that you want to mix into
      your color.
