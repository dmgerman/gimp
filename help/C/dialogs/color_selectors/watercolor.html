The Watercolor Color Selector
</H1>

<P>
This color selector resembles the little water cup you use for
blending colors when you're making a watercolor painting.
</P>

<P>
If you want to mix a color, simply move the mouse over the color scale
while pressing the left mouse button. If the color gets too dark you
just press the right mouse button to fade the color. You can also set
the pressure with which you collect the colors. Setting a low pressure
means you have to drag more to get a dark, highly saturated color, but
gives better control over the mixing.
</P>

<P>
You can save ten colors in the dialog. If you want to save a color
that you have mixed, just press new and the color will appear in the
color array. Remember that you can only save ten colors.  If you
already have ten colors and save a new color, the oldest one will be
replaced.
