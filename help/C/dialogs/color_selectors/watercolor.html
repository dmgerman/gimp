      This color selector resembles the little water cup you use for blending colors
      when you're making a watercolor painting.
      <P>
      If you want to mix a color, simply move the mouse over the color scale while
      pressing the left mouse button. If the color get to dark you just press the
      right mouse button to fade the color. You can also set the pressure which
      you collect the colors with. Setting a low pressure and you have to drag
      more to get a dark highly saturated color, on the other hand you will have
      a better control of your mixing.
      <P>
      You can save ten colors in the dialog. If you want to save a color that you
      have mixed just press new and the color will end up in the color array. Remember
      that you can only save ten colors, if you all ready have ten colors and save
      a new color the oldest one will be erased.
