    The Brush Editor dialog allows you to make alterations to brushes. 
At the top of the dialog, you can see the name of the brush (a new 
brush will be called "Untitled"). This name can be edited to change the 
brush name. If you choose a name which is the same as another brush, 
Gimp will suffix "#<em>x</em>" (where <em>x</em> is a number).
    <P>
    Below the title, you can see a preview of how the final brush will 
look. If you resize the brush to a size larger than the preview area, 
the preveiw will be scaled, and the scale factor shown below it as a 
ratio, such as 2:1 for 50% zoomed out.

    The remainder of the dialog controls how the brush will be look. 
The Radius controls the distance from the center of the brush to the 
furthest edge in pixels. The radius of a brush is 100 pixels.
    <P>
    The Hardness slider controls how much the brush fades towards it's 
edges. A value closer to 1 will give a sharp edge, and closer to 0 will 
give a fuzzy, blured effect.
    <P>
    The Aspect Ratio defines the diameter vertical as a ratio against the 
horizontal diameter. A value of 1.0 will give a round brush since this 
means that the horizontal diameter is 1x the vertical. The maximum 
value is 20, where the horizontal diameter is 20x the vertical, which 
gives a very squashed eliptical brush.
    <P>
    The final setting is Angle which is used when the aspect ratio is 
more than 1.0. The angle can be between 0 and 180 degrees, which works 
in an anti-clockwise direction.
