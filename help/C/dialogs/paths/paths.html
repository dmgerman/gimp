    paths to that statement misses a lot of their functionality
    though. A better way to see it is as a way to manage vector
    curves.  If you are familiar with vector drawing programs such as
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Adobe Illustrator</SPAN
> and
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Corel Draw</SPAN
>, then paths will be
    something very familiar.

>    You will work with paths just like you work with bezier curves.
    Bezier curves are, as a matter of fact, Paths. You may just not be
    aware of the power that is hidden within them. The big difference
    is that you can edit your curve, you can paint with your curve, or
    even save, import and export the curve.

	      click to add a point. This will create a curve with
	      sharp corners. If instead you click and drag you will
	      stretch and form the curve related to the added control
	      point. If you create the path this way, you will end up

	      will now appear inside the path. This command will turn
	      the path into a selection. Clicking outside the
	      previously closed curve will start a new bezier curve.
	      The square path to selection command will now be
	      deactivated and you can add more points inside the
	      previously closed curve. You can have as many closed
	      curves as you want, but you can only have one that isn't
	      closed in the same Path. This may look like a
	      limitation, but you can have as many paths as you like.
	      This will enable you to have as many unclosed curves as
	      you want as long as they are in separate paths.
