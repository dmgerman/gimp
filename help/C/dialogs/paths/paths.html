      Basically paths is a way to store bezier selections. But if you limit path
      to that statement you will miss a lot of functionality. A better way to see
      it is a way to manage vectors curves. If you are familiar with vector drawing
      programs such as e.g Sketch, Illustrator&reg; or Corel Draw&reg; then paths
      will be something that is very natural.
      <P>
      You will work with paths just like you work with bezier curves. Bezier
      (select)curves are as a matter of fact Paths you may just not be aware of
      the power that is hidden. The big difference is that you can edit your curve,
      and you can paint with your curve or even save, import and export the curve.
      <P>
      There are three commando areas in the Paths dialog, the top edit area, the
      path area with it's right button popup menu and the bottom control area.

	  New Path, you will create a new path and activate the bezier tool. The path
	  is named Path X where X is a number. If you want to rename it you have to
	  double click on the path in the path area. If you do so a name dialog will
	  appear.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Duplicate Path: Will duplicate your currently active path. To activate/mark
	  a path you single click on it in the path area. The name is by default OldName#X
	  where X indicates the N:th duplication of the path.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Path to selection: Will create a selection out of a path. Note the path doesn't
	  have to be closed. The created selection will simply join the endpoints with
	  a line that will follow the curves direction in each endpoint.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Selection to Path: Will create a path out of a selection. Beware of complicated
	  selection such as selections done by quick mask or select by color. Such
	  selection will create very complexed paths, which are hard to control.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Stroke path: Will stroke the path with the currently (active device) active
	  brush. The path doesn't have to be closed. The stoke will stoke from one
	  endpoint to another.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Delete Path: Will delete the currently active path (Note: no confirmation
	  dialog).

	  <EM>Edit area:</EM>
	<DD>
	  To be able to edit a path the bezier tool must be active, if it isn't you
	  will not be able to edit a path. In the top edit area we count from left
	  to right.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  New point. This command will add a control point to the path and make aline
	  from the last control point to the new point. There a two ways to create
	  a path either you just click to add a point. This will crate a curve with
	  sharp corners. However if you click and drag you will stretch and form the
	  curve related to the added control point. If you create the path this way
	  you will end up with a curve with smooth "corners". You can naturally combine
	  the two ways to create curves. <BR>
	  You close your path by joining the first and last point (this is done by
	  adding the last point really close to the first point) a square sign will
	  now appear inside the path. This command will turn the path into a selection.
	  However if you click outside the previously closed curve you will start a
	  new bezier curve. The square path to selection command will now be deactivated
	  and you can add more points inside the previously closed curve. You can have
	  as many closed curves as you want but you can only have one that isn't closed
	  in the same Path. This may look like a limitation but you can have as many
	  paths as you like which will enable you to have as may unclosed curves as
	  you want as long as they are in separate paths.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Add point: Will add a point to your curve. The new point must be located
	  on the curve, you can't add a point outside the curve. You will notice that
	  your cursor will have a little + sign when you are over a curve in the image.
	  When the + sign appears it means that you are able to add a point by clicking
	  on the curve. The new point will be adjusted to fit the curve and the curves
	  shape will not be altered.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Remove point: Will remove a point in your curve. The point must be a between
	  the endpoints in a non-closed curve. If the curve is closed it can be any
	  point within the curve. You must however always have two point in the curve.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Edit Point: Will allow you to adjust the curve. When you click on an anchor
	  point, two little handles appear. If you pull the handles, they will change
	  size and direction and shape a curve. By pressing Ctrl, you can move an anchor
	  point anyway you like. To be able to adjust each handle separately you have
	  to press Shift.

	  The path area is where you choose the path that you want to work with. If
	  you right click on a path a popup menu will appear with command for copy,
	  paste etc. please see <A HREF="../../paths/index.html">Path Index</A> for
	  reference of those commands. The default name of a path is simple it's just
	  Path followed with a number. It can sometimes be really useful too change
	  name. To change name simply double click on the path and a name dialog will
	  appear.
