      Will scale the image content, &nbsp;and also make the canvas size either
      smaller or bigger. The difference between Scale Image and Set Canvas Size.
      Is that Set Canvas Size will enable you to have a smaller or bigger canvas
      with out scaling the image content (i.e it will only add some space around
      the image or clip the image). NOTE: Scale Image will scale the whole image
      you can scale only the currently active layer with the Scale Layer command.
      <P>
      You will set the new image size either by altering the size or the ratio.
      You can also set resolution of the image. If you lower the resolution the
      image will get bigger (in real units not in pixels). You therefore have to
      compensate it with a smaller pixels size if you still want the same image
      size but a lower resolution. It will naturally be vise versa if you increase
      the resolution. This is why you have a Pixel Dimension area (even if you
      can use e.g mm in that section too). &nbsp;
