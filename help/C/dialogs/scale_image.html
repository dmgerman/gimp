      Will scale the image content and the canvas size. The difference
      between Scale Image and Set Canvas Size is that Set Canvas Size
      will resize the canvas without scaling image content with out
      scaling the image content (i.e it will only add some space around
      the image or clip the image). NOTE: Scale Image will scale the
      whole image.   You can scale only the active layer with the
      Scale Layer command.
      <P>
      You will set the new image size either by altering the size or the ratio.
      You can also set the resolution of the image. If you lower the
      resolution, the image will get bigger (in real units, but not in
      pixels).  You therefore have to
      compensate it with a smaller pixels size if you still want the same image
      size but a lower resolution. It will naturally be vice versa if
      you increase the resolution. Pixel Dimension area is used to
      resize the pixels.
