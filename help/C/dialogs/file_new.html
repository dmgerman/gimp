      File New will create a new Gimp image in either RGB (color) or Grayscale
      mode. You can't create a Index image since you will not know which colors
      your palette should have. Beside working in Index mode is not a good choose
      instead work in RGB and convert to Index just before saving the Image.
      <P>
      How to create a new image:
      <P>
      <DL>
	<DT>
	  Set the resolution
	<DD>
	  The resolution is how many pixels per length unit you what your image to
	  built up with. The default 72ppi (72 pixels/inch) is good if you want to
	  create web graphics (you can alter the default value in the preference dialog).
	  However if you going to print your image you will probably need a lot more
	  than 72ppi. <BR>
	  You have several chooises about how you want to measure the resolution pixels
	  per inch, mm, points or picas (there is also a option more which will bring
	  up a dialog with even more choices). We suggest that you stick to ppi since
	  that the most common format when you are dealing with images.<BR>
	  You can have different X and Y resolutions by unchecking the chain but that
	  is not recommended.
	<DT>
	  Set the Size
	<DD>
	  You have two options either &nbsp;you can set it directly in pixels in the
	  top frame or in a real world unit in the middle frame. If you are working
	  with web graphics we suggest that you deal with pixels directly. If you going
	  to print your image then setting in a real world unit is the preferred.
	<DT>
	  Set the mode/type of image
	<DD>
	  Set the mode to either RGB or Grayscale
	<DT>
	  Set Fill Type
	<DD>
	  Foreground takes the currently active foreground color of the toolbox<BR>
	  Background take the currently active background color of the toolbox<BR>
	  White sets the fill color to white no matter what the toolbox
	  color&nbsp;is<BR>
	  Transparent &nbsp;prevents the image from filling instead you will get a
	  totally "empty" image to start with.&nbsp;
      </DL>
      <P>
      The Reset button resets all values their default values. OK creates a new
      image.
