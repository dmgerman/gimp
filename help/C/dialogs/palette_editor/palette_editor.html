      In the palette editor you can edit palettes, create new palettes, import
      palettes, merge and delete palettes. You also have a option to refresh palettes.
      You have to use this option to make palettes installed after you started
      Gimp available and ready for use.

	  Edit Palette:
	<DD>
	  Either you can choose the palette to edit in the palette select dialog or
	  you activate it in the palette editor with a single left clicking on it.
	  The palette that you are about to edit will now appear in the edit area.
	  If the palette has a large amount of colors then each color cell in the palette
	  can be rather small. To be able to view and edit the palette you can therefore
	  zoom in and out with the zoom buttons.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  To change the name of a color cell you first mark it by left clicking on
	  it. The Name field next to the zoom buttons will be activated and you can
	  change the name.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  The edit menu will appear if you right click in the edit frame. Choose to
	  edit and the standard Gimp Color selector will appear and you will be able
	  to change to color in the color cell that you right-clicked in. New will
	  add a color at the end of the palette. The new color cell will inherit the
	  color of the cell that you brought up the menu in. To alter the newly created
	  cell you have to right-click in it and choose edit. Delete in the right click
	  pop up menu will delete the color cell from which you brought up the menu
	  in (you will not get a confirmation window).<BR>
	<DT>
	  New Palette
	<DD>
	  Will create a new empty palette in the edit frame, a confirmation window
	  with where you <A HREF="new_palette.html">name</A> the new palette will appear.
	  When you have created your new palette, you have to insert color cells. You
	  do that by right-clicking anywhere in the edit area and choose new from the
	  popup menu.<BR>
	<DT>
	  Delete Palette
	<DD>
	  Will delete your palette. NOTE: It will delete the palette without the presence
	  of confirmation dialog. Remember it's a UNIX program from the beginning i.e
	  you are supposed to know what you are doing.<BR>
	<DT>
	  Import Palette
	<DD>
	  Will bring up the <A HREF="import_palette.html">Import</A> dialog where you
	  can create a new platte from a gradient, image or indexed palette.
	<DT>
	<DT>
	  Merge Palette
	<DD>
	  You are able to merge palettes in the editor, the new palette is a combination
	  of the selected palettes. To merge two or several palettes you have to mark
	  the palettes that you want to merge and click on Merge which will bring up
	  the <A HREF="merge_palette.html">Name</A> dialog. There are two ways to mark
	  palettes either you &lt;Modkey&gt; click, you will then mark a single palette
	  each time (or unmark). You can also &lt;Modkey&gt; click which will mark
	  all palettes from the first marked to the last marked palette.
