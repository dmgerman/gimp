      The Image canvas is the boundary of the image. Even if you can have a smaller
      or larger layer than the image boundary size the maximum image are that you
      can view is determined by the boundary size.
      <P>
      The size area will control how big or small your new canvas will be just
      as when you created a new image. The Offset area will control how your canvas
      is clipped or expanded.

	  The offset fields will control where your upper left corner of the old canvas
	  will be in the new canvas. The best way to control the new location and how
	  it will be clipped. Is to drag the "canvas preview" in the Offset frame to
	  the right position. After that you make the final touch with the spin buttons
	  (or type it in by hand). The thin outline is the new canvas size and you
	  have to drag the old canvas to the right position so it will be clipped according
	  to your demands.

      <P>
      If you uncheck the chain in the Size area, you will be able to have different
      ratios of the new canvas. It's therefore possible e.g to have a canvas which
      is smaller in X direction and bigger in Y direction than before the resize.
