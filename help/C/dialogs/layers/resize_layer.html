      The Layer Boundary Size lets you set the the boundary of the layer. Remember
      you can have a smaller or larger layer than the image boundary size. When
      you enlarge the boundary size, then you will add some space to paint on to
      your layer. Naturally it will be wise versa when you make the boundary size
      it smaller.
      <P>
      The size area will control how big or small your new layer boundary will
      be just as when you created a new layer. The Offset area will control how
      your layer is clipped or expanded.

	  The offset fields will control where your upper left corner of the old layer
	  will be in the "new" layer. The best way to control the new location and
	  how and where the layer will be clipped. Is to drag the "layer preview" in
	  the Offset area to the right position, and&nbsp;make the final touch with
	  the spin buttons (or type it in by hand). The thin outline is the new layer
	  size and you have to drag the old layer to the right position so it will
	  be clipped according to your demands.

      <P>
      If you uncheck the chain in the Size area, you will be able to have different
      ratios when you make the "new" layer . It's therefore possible e.g to have
      a layer which is smaller in X direction and bigger in Y direction than before
      you altered the layer boundary size.
