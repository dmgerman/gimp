      The Layer(s) dialog is the main interface to interact with layers present
      in a Gimp image. You can think of layers as a stack of slides or clothes
      on your body. Gimp gives you several methods of combining layers with help
      of <A HREF="../../modes.html">modes</A>. The mode of a layer will determine
      how it will interact with other layers present in the image.
      <P>
      Before you can do anything with a layer the layer must be activated (if you
      only have one layer that layer is always active). You do so by clicking on
      the layer name, if you double click on the name you will be able to set the
      <A HREF="edit_layer_attributes.html">layer attributes</A> of that layer.
      <P>
      If you right click on the layer name you will be able to access the layer
      menu, with in the layer menu you have access to several other layer commands,
      see <A HREF="../../layers/index.html">Index</A>.
      <P>
      With the Opacity slider will you control the over general transparency of
      the currently active layer. The Keep Trans check button controls what ever
      you can or can't paint on transparent areas of the layer. If it is checked
      then you can paint on transparent areas of the layer (i.e you can only paint
      on opaque areas).
      <P>
      In the button row you have six layer command buttons,
      <A HREF="new_layer.html">New Layer</A>,
      <A HREF="../../layers/stack/stack.html">Raise Layer</A>,
      <A HREF="../../layers/stack/stack.html">Lower Layer</A>,
      <A HREF="../../layers/duplicate_layer.html">Duplicate Layer</A>,
      <A HREF="../../layers/anchor_layer.html">Anchor Layer</A> and
      <A HREF="../../layers/delete_layer.html">Delete Layer</A>.
      <P>
      Gimp's Layer dialog is by default Auto switched, it will always show the
      image that you are working with. You can however switch this off and choose
      another image to work with in the drop down menu.
