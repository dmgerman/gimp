      Will add a layer mask to the currently active layer. A layer mask is a way
      to control transparency of the current layer . The mask it self is a grayscale
      "image" where black pixels will make the layer totally transparent and white
      pixels will make it opaque.
      <P>
      The fill dialog enables you to choose the initial fill of the layer mask.
      Black which will make the layer totally transparent, white which will make
      the layer totally opace or the alpha channel of the layer. When you choose
      the alpha channel the transparency of each pixels will be mapped to a grayscale
      value in the mask. If you want to further manipulate the transparency in
      a layer this can be a very good option (e.g maybe you have softly erased
      some parts of the image and want to continue to manipulate the transparency).
      <P>
      To work with the layer mask you have to active it, you do that by clicking
      on the thumbnail image of the mask. However you will not see the mask you
      will just see the result of your mask operations. To see the mask you have
      to &lt;ZZZZ&gt; click on the thumbnail. If you want to see you layer without
      the mask you have to &lt;ZZZZ&gt; click on the thumbnail. Remember
      to to click one again with the same modification key to exit the current
      "preview" state.
