      You have two tab folders in the Color Palette dialog. One to
      select the palette
      you want to use and one to interact with the palette that you selected.

	  Within the select tab, you will see small thumbnails of all available
	  palettes. There is also information about the number of
	  colors in the palettes and their names. You can
	  choose a palette for direct
	  usage by simply clicking on it and shifting to the Palette
	  tab. You can edit the palette you selected by clicking on
	  the edit button which will bring
	  up the <A HREF="palette_editor/palette_editor.html">Color
	  Palette Editor</A>
	  dialog.  Note that you can also edit a palette in the
	  Palette tab folder,
	  but the Color Palette Editor gives more options.

	  Within the palette tab, you interact with your palette. The primary
	  usage of the dialog is, naturally, to choose colors from the
	  palette. (It is very cumbersome to use the color selector to
	  choose colors when
	  you work with a project. The best way to work is to have a
	  color palette).

	  You can, however, also use this window to edit the
	  palette. Right click (and hold) on a color
	  cell and a menu will appear. Within the menu you can edit
	  the color in the
	  cell, delete the cell, or create a brand new cell which will
	  be added in the
	  bottom row of your palette. The name which appears when you
	  either right or left click on a color cell can also be
	  changed.  All changes that you make in the
	  palette will be autosaved and available immediately.

      <P>
      The zoom buttons enable you to zoom in and out in the palette.
