      You have two tabfolders in the Color Palette dialog. One to select the palette
      you want to use and one to interact with the palette that you selected.

	  With in the select tab folder will you see a small thumbnails of all available
	  palettes. There is also information about the number of colors in the palettes
	  and the name of the palettes. You can either choose a palette for direct
	  usage. Just clicking on it and shift to the Palette tab folder. You can edit
	  the palette you selected by clicking on the edit button which will bring
	  up the <A HREF="palette_editor/palette_editor.html">Color Palette Edit</A>
	  dialog. Note that you can also edit a palette in the Palette tab folder,
	  but the Color Palette Editor will give you much more options.

	  Palette tab folder

	  With in the palette tab folder will you interact with your palette. The prime
	  usage of the dialog is naturally to choose colors from the palette. (Remember
	  that it's very cumbersome to use the color selector to choose colors when
	  you work with a project. The right way to work is to have a color palette).
	  <BR>

	  You can however edit the palette also. Right click (and hold) on a color
	  cell and a menu will appear. With in the menu can you edit the color in the
	  cell, delete the cell or create a brand new cell which will be added in the
	  bottom row of your palette. The name which appears when you either right
	  or left click on a color cell is editable. All changes that you do in the
	  palette will be autosaved and available right of.

      <P>
      The zoom buttons enables you to zoom in and out in the palette.
