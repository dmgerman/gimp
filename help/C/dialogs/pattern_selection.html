      Lets you set the active pattern. The pattern you choose will also be viewable
      as a preview in the toolbox status area. The patterns are often bigger than
      the view area in the dialog. To be able to view the entire pattern just press
      and hold on the pattern, and a popup window will appear showing you the entire
      pattern. If you have several devices you will assign the pattern to the currently
      active device.
      <P>
      If you install a pattern after you started Gimp you must click on Refresh
      to be able to use and view it.
