      The Gradient Editor allows you to create or edit complex gradients that you
      can use with e.g the blend tool.
      <P>
      You'll find a list of all available gradients under Gradients, and the currently
      selected gradient can be seen in a preview window. &nbsp; The buttons to
      the right let you create, copy, delete, save and refresh gradients and save
      as POV-Ray format. You can also zoom the gradient with the zoom buttons present
      in the main dialog.
      <P>
      The triangles at the bottom of the gradient preview window are color section
      markings. Two kinds of marks exist: black endpoints and white midpoints.
      The area between two black points is called a segment. You select a segment
      by clicking on it. A selected segment turns a darker shade of gray. Most
      work that you do in the gradient editor will be about changing and editing
      those segments in one way or another.
      <P>
      &#176; You can move an entire selection by clicking in the darker gray field
      and dragging.
      <P>
      &#176; If you move a white midpoint and affect the color transition by dragging
      it.
      <P>
      &#176; Dragging a black endpoint &nbsp;will stretch the area between that
      endpoint and the midpoint
      <P>
      &#176; If you click on an endpoint, then press Shift and drag, you will compress
      or expand the entire selection.
      <P>
      &#176; You can extend or add to a selection by pressing the Shift key and
      clicking on another segment.
      <P>
      Any of the described manipulations can be used on extended selections.

	The Popup Menu
      </H4>
      <P>
      If you press the right mouse button in the gradient preview window, a menu
      will appear for further editing of the selected segment.
      <P>
      You can edit the left or right color by invoking left or right endpoint color.
      The Load from and Save to menu options allow you to load a color from an
      RGBA channel to an endpoint,or to save a RGBA channel.
      <P>
      In the Blending function for segment submenu, you will find some functions
      that control how the appearance of the gradient in your selection.
      <P>
      The coloring type for segment submenu lets you choose a color model for your
      selection or segment. You can choose Plain RGB and two kinds of HSV.
      <P>
      The Segment commands will work on the selected segment. If you have selected
      more than one segment, they will not be treated as a unit.
      <P>
      &#176; Split segment at midpoint: Puts an endpoint at the midpoint and then
      divides the two new segments.
      <P>
      &#176; Split segment uniformly: Splits to a specified amount o f segments.
      <P>
      &#176; Delete segment: Deletes the entire selection.
      <P>
      &#176; Re-center segment's midpoint: Re-centers the midpoints
      <P>
      &#176; Re-distribute handles in segment: Evenly distributes all the points
      in the segment.
      <P>
      The Selection operations submenu allows you to flip or replicate the segment
      and also allows you to blend the endpoints' colors and/or opacity:
