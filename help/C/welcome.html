	About Gimp
      </H2>
      <P>
      Gimp is an acronym for <A href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A> Image 
      Manipulation Program. Gimp is software
      suitable for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image
      authoring. It's capabilities as a image manipulation programs makes it a 
      worthy contender to other similar programs such as Adobe Photoshop or Corel
      PhotoPaint.
      <P>
      The biggest advantage that Gimp has is that it is a free program,
      and it can be downloaded from the Internet. But even more importantly, it's
      not freeware. Gimp is an OSS (Open Source Software) program covered by the
      <A href="http://www.gnu.org/license/GPL/">GPL license</A>, which gives you 
      the freedom to access and also to change the
      source code that makes up the program. This is how and why Gimp is constantly
      being developed and improved.

	About the Help System
      </H2>
      <P>
      The Gimp Help System will provide you with the necessary information how
      to use all the functions provided by Gimp. It will do so in a short and effective
      way so the best way to describe it is as a extended quick reference to Gimp.
      The difference between the Gimp help system and a pure quick reference is
      that the help system will describe the functionality and how to use the function
      in a productive manner.
      <H4>
	How to Use the Help System
      </H4>
      <P>
      The built in Gimp help browser (which we hope that you are using) has three
      note book tabs. The one that you are reading this text in is the main note
      book tab in which all help texts are displayed. The Context note book tab
      will show the context of the help system and the index note book tab will
      show the index of the help system. The advantage of the built in help browser
      is that you can easily navigate the help system in e.g the Context note and
      display the help text in the main note book tab.
      <H4>
	What to Expect of the Help System
      </H4>
      <P>
      Besides the description of the functionality of the functions in Gimp. You
      will also find descriptions of how to organize your work with Gimp, how to
      setup Gimp, various tips and tricks, quick reference page of short cuts and
      modifier keys, News of Gimp 1.2 for old Gimp users, etc. You will find all
      this extra information in the Context note book tab, since they are general
      help items and not specific to a special Gimp function.
      <P>
      You will also find links to the Gimp Users Manual and the Gimp Users Tutorial
      to where you will find more in depth information of the function and how
      to user the function when you work in Gimp. We hope that you will find the
      links useful and that they will enlighten you and give you an extended and
      professional understanding of Gimp, image manipulation and art.
