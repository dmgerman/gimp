	The undo function allows you to revert your image to how it 
appeared before making the last change to it. For example, if you paint 
a single stroke with the paintbrush on your image, clicking undo will 
remove it. If you paint two stroke, releasing the mouse button in 
between, you can press undo twice to undo both changes. If you want to 
undo multiple changes in one go, you may prefer to use the undo dialog 
(Image Menu -> Dialogs -> Undo History).
	<P>
	You should note that you can configure the number of undo 
levels (how many steps back you can take) in Preferences -> Environment 
-> Levels of Undo. You can set this figure as high as you like, but you 
should note that every undo step takes up memory so you should set this 
figure too high if you don't have much memory.
