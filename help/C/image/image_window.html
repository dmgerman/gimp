	The image window is the one that you will see when you are 
composing your image.
	<P>
	The main part of the window is the section in which your image 
can be created. See the help for the tools for more information on what 
can be done.
	<P>
	By default, the image window in bordered at the top and left by 
a ruler which is measured in pixels at 100 pixel intervals. There is an 
arrow on each ruler which show the vertical and horizontal position of 
the cursor. The position of the cursor can also be seen in figures at 
the bottom left corner of the window. This is in the format <em>x</em> 
direction, <em>y</em> direction and is in pixels.
	<P>
	Also at the bottom of the image window (on the "Statusbar") is 
the filename and other information about the image such as the zoom 
level, which is also displayed as the title to the window. The 
information displayed can be configured in Preferences -> Image Windows 
-> Image Title Format. Next to this is a section which displayed a 
progress bar when an operation will take a long time. That action can 
be aborted by clicking the "Cancel" button next to it.
	<P>
	Just above the co-ordinates display, there are two buttons, one 
which shows a dotted square, and the other a red square. Clicking the 
red square invokes the "Quick Mask". This adds an extra channel which 
can be edited to make complex selections. Once the mask has been 
edited to your satisfaction, click the dotted square to convert it into 
a standard selection. The color an opacity of the mask can be 
configured by double-clicking either button.
	<P>
	The final feature of the image window is the preview box - this 
looks like four arrows going outwards and is at the bottom right 
corner. Clicking and holding this button will show a small preview of 
the whole image. This is particularly use if you are working at very 
high zoom levels and want to see how your changes affect the 
overall image.
	<P>
	Many of these features can be configured, or turned on and off 
in Preferences -> Image Windows, so you may need to make some changes 
to see all the features.
