>Scaling</SPAN
></DT
><DD
><P
>	    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Scaling</SPAN

	    that allows scaling of the image. The image can be scaled
	    in either percent of the printable area (NOT the page in
	    this case) or pixels per inch (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PPI</SPAN
>) via
	    a <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>radio button</SPAN
> below the slider.
	    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PPI</SPAN
> allows matching image resolution to
	    printer resolution.  The image may be scaled using either
	    method to between 5 and 100% of the imageable area. It is
	    not possible to crop with the Print plugin. In
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Percent</SPAN
> mode, the image is scaled
	    so that neither axis will be longer than the percent of
	    the printable area specified. For example, if you print an
	    image at 20%, it will be possible to tile the image 5
	    times on one axis and at least 5 times on the other. To
	    the right of the radio button is a button called
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Set Image Scale</SPAN
>. This sets the
	    scaling to <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PPI</SPAN
>, and sets the resolution
	    as closely as possible to the resolution stored in the
	    image. To the right of the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Set Image
	    Scale</SPAN
> button are two boxes that allow entry of
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>width</SPAN
> and
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>height</SPAN
> of the image. These set the
	    scaling mode to <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PPI</SPAN
>.  Specifying one
	    automatically sets the other, and the image is
	    repositioned as needed to prevent it from falling off the
	    edge of the page.

	    Photograph mode dithers more slowly, but produces more
	    accurate colors. Finally, Monochrome mode can be used to
	    print absolute black and white very quickly. To the right
	    of these four radio buttons is a button called
	    <SPAN
