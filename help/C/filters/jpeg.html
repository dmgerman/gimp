	<P>
	Allows you to configure the settings for saving a JPEG image.
	<H4>
	Comments
	</H4>
	<P>
	You can add a comment to the image up to 32,768 characters 
	(32KB) by 
	entering text in the Image Comments box. A default comment can be 
	defined in Preferences.
	<H4>
	Quality
	</H4>
	<P>
	The parameter settings allow you to alter the way that the 
	JPEG file is saved to get the best trade-off between image 
	quality and filesize. The Quality slider changes the quality of 
	the image - a high number (1.00 being the maximum) gives a 
	better image quality but a larger filesize. If you check 
	"Preview (in Image Window)" the image window will dynamically 
	update as you move the quality slider (or change any of the other 
	parameter settings) and you will be able to see what the 
resultant filesize will be in bytes and kilobytes (KB). Note that 
depending on the size of the image, it may take a moment to update the 
preview and filesize information after adjusting the settings.
	<H4>
	Smoothing
	</H4>
	<P>
	The smoothing slider adjusts how much the image is blurred to 
make the image appear a higher quality. A higher value will lose some 
of the detail in an image, but reduce the filesize.
	<H4>
	Restart Markers
	</H4>
	<P>
	Restart markers are useful for transmitting an image over an 
unreliable network. If a file gets corrupted, it will only be corrupted 
up to the next restart marker. Restart markers add a small amount to the 
filesize of an image. Restart markers can be between every 1 row (many 
markers) and every 64 rows (few markers).
	<H4>
	Progressive Mode
	</H4>
	<P>
	Progressive mode means that a supporting viewer (such as 
Netscape Navigator) can show a low quality version of an image which 
progressively improves as the image loads until the full image is 
displayed. This may slightly increases filesize (but not always), and 
is not supported by all viewers.
	<H4>
	Force Baseline JPEG
	</H4>
	<P>
	Enabling "Force Baseline JPEG" makes Gimp write a JPEG which 
will be readable by all decoders (viewers). This often results in a 
larger filesize and/or worse image quality, especially at low quality 
settings.
	<P>
	<H4>
	Subsampling
	</H4>
	<P>
	Subsampling defines how information is discarded as a ratio of 
color (which can be discarded more with less dicernable effect) against 
brightness. It is defined for the two chroma (color) channels - 
red/green (Cr) and blue/yellow (Cb) - as relative to the luma 
(brightness) channel (Y) of the image by downsampling the image by a 
factor of two in either the <i>x</i> direction only, or both the 
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions. This is shown by the format Y,Cr,Cb, 
so "1x1,1x1,1x1" gives no subsampling, and thus the highest image 
quality. "2x2,1x1,1x1" downsamples both the Cr and Cb channels by half, 
giving the highest compression available here. "2x1,1x1,1x1" only 
downsamples the Cr channel, again by half.
	<H4>
	DCT Method
	</H4>
	<P>
	The DCT method only influences quality vs. speed. The fastest 
method is "Fast integer" which has a slight quality disadvantage 
against "Integer". "Floating-point" may give a marginal increase in 
quality but will be slower to load.
