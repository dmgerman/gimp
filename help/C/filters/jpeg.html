>	    Subsampling defines how information is discarded as a
	    ratio of color (which can be discarded more with less
	    discernable effect) against brightness. It is defined for
	    the two chroma (color) channels &mdash; red/green (Cr) and
	    blue/yellow (Cb) &mdash; as relative to the luma
	    (brightness) channel (Y) of the image by downsampling the
	    image by a factor of two in either the x direction only,
	    or both the x and y directions. This is shown by the
	    format Y,Cr,Cb, so <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>1x1,1x1,1x1</SPAN
>
	    gives no subsampling, and thus the highest image quality.
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>2x2,1x1,1x1</SPAN

	    Cr and Cb channels by half, giving the highest compression
	    available here. <SPAN

	    downsamples the Cr channel, again by half.
