	Compression
	</H4>
	TIFF files can be compressed in a number of ways to reduce the 
filesize. LZW (Lempel Ziv Welch) compression is the same method used in 
GIF images, and produces a significant reduction in filesize without 
losing any image information (it is a lossless method). It should 
be noted that LZW compression is covered by a restrictive Unisys 
<A href="http://www.unisys.com/unisys/lzw/">license</A>.
	<P>
	PackBits compression is often used on Macintosh systems and is 
a form of Run Length Encoding (RLE) which, like LZW, is a lossless 
method.
	<P>
	Deflate compression, sometime known as "zip" compression, uses 
another variant of the LZW compression method and so gives similar 
results, but is not restricted by any licences. LZW compression should 
be used on logo type images such as maps and line diagrams.
	<P>
	JPEG compression is the same compression methods used when 
saving JPEG files. JPEG compression should be used on photographs or 
realistic scenes.
	<P>
	Finally, you can leave the TIFF uncompressed for maximum 
quality, but be warned that filesizes can be very large.
	<H4>
	Comment
	</H4>
	<P>
	As with JPEG (and some other formats) a comment can be added 
to the image up to 32KB. A default comment for new images can be set in 
Preferences.
