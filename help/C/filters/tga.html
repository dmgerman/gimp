	The TGA format was developed by <A 
href="http://www.truevision.com">Truevision</A> as a way of storing 
color images, specfically 24 and 32-bit color images. The format is 
sometimes known incorrectly as "Targa" which refers to the graphics 
hardware the format was originally designed for.
	<P>
	The TGA format is lossless (no image data is discarded during 
saving) which supports high-color images.

	The TGA format can be RLE (Run Length Encoding) compressed 
which results in significantly smaller filesizes, but will be give 
slower performance when handling the image.
