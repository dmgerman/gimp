	* C/*/Makefile.am: automatically create the symbolic links e.g. to
	"../dialogs".

	* C/*: changed some help file names to match the new menu structure.

	* C/image/mode/*
	* C/image/colors/auto/*: new directories. Moved some files there

	old places.

	* make-help-stubs.sh
	* makefile-am.sh
	* makelinks.sh: removed because we no longer need them.

	formerly done by the removed dir-template.sh
